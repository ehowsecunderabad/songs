Song 83 - O little town of Bethlehem

Verse 1
O little town of Bethlehem,
How still we see thee lie!
Above Thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by;
Yet in Thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting Light;
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in Thee tonight.

Verse 2
For Christ is born of Mary,
and gathered all above,
While mortals sleep, the angels keep;
Their watch of wondering love
O morning stars together,
Proclaim the holy birth,
And Praises sing to God the King,
And peace to men on earth.

Verse 3
How silently, how silently,
The wondrous gift is given!
So God imparts to human hearts
The blessings of His Heaven.
No ear may hear His coming;
But in this world of sin,
Where meek souls will receive Him,
still, the dear Christ enters in.

Verse 4
O holy Child of Bethlehem,
Descend to us, we pray;
Cast out our sin, and enter in,
Be born in us today.
We hear the Christmas angels
The great glad tidings tell:
Oh, come to us, abide with us,
Our Lord Emmanuel.
