Song 229 - Lord I lift your name on high

Lord I lift your name on high,
Lord I love to`sing your praises,
I am so glad you are in my life,
I am so glad you came to save us.

You came from heaven to the earth
To show the way,
From the earth to the cross
My debts to pay,

From the cross to the grave
From the grave to the sky,
Lord I lift your name on high.
