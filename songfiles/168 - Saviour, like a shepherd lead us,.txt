Song 168 - Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,

Saviour, like a shepherd lead us,
Much we need Thy tender care;
In Thy pleasant pastures feed us,
For our use Thy folds prepare:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast bought us, Thine we are;

Verse 2
We are Thine; do Thou befriend us,
Be the Guardian of our way;
Keep Thy flock, from sin defend us,
Seek us when we go astray:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Hear, Oh hear us, when we pray;

Verse 3
Thou hast promised to receive us,
Poor and sinful though we be;
Thou hast mercy to relieve us,
Gracetocleanse, andpow'r tofree;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Early let us, turn to Thee;

Verse 4
Early let us seek Thy favor;
Early let us do Thy will;
Blessed Lord and only Saviour,
With Thy love our bosoms fill:
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still;
Blessed Jesus, Blessed Jesus,
Thou hast loved us, love us still.
