Song 186 - My teaching, son

My teaching, son, do not forget
For lengthened years ere life's sunset.
Trust God, not what your reason says,
Acknowledge Him in all your ways.

2 Give God your best; His funds give first
He'll fill your barns,
your winepress burst!
His discipline do not despise;
His love requires Him to chastise.

3 Good sense exceeds great wealth in
worth
The Lord by wisdom made the
earth.
From her pursuit you must not cease
With others, do not strive; seek
peace.

4 The treasures which God here
makes known
Are fully held by Christ alone;
By faith joint-heirs with Him we're
made,
Great riches to our credit laid!
