Song 406 - If we call to Him He will answer us

If we call to Him He will answer us
If we run to Him, He will run to us
If we lift our hands, He will lift us up
Come now praise His name all ye
saints of God
Sing for joy to God our strength
Sing for joy to God our strength, our
strength
Draw near to Him, He is here with us
Give Him your love, He's in love with
us
He will heal our hearts, He will cleanse
our hands
If we rend our hearts, He will heal our land
