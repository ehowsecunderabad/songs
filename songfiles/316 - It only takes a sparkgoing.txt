Song 316 - It only takes a sparkgoing

It only takes a spark, to get the fire
going,
And soon all those around can warm
up in its glowing.
That's how it is with God's love,
Once you've experienced it,
You'll spread His love to every one;
You want to pass it on.
What a wondrous time is spring,
When all the trees are budding,
The birds begin to sing, the flowers
start their blooming.
That's how it is with God's love,
Once You've experienced it, You want
to sing,
It's fresh like spring; You want to pass
it on.
I wish for you my friend, this happiness,
that I've found,
You can depend on Him, It matters
not where you're bound.
I'll shout it from the mountain top,
I want my world to know,
The Lord of love has come to me,
I want to pass it on.
