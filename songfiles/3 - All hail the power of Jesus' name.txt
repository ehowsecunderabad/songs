Song 3 - All hail the power of Jesus' name

Verse 1
All hail the power of Jesus' name,
Let angels prostrate fall;
Let angels prostrate fall;
Bring forth the royal diadem,

Chorus 1
And crown Him, crown Him,
crown Him, crown Him,
And crown Him Lord of all.

Verse 2
Ye chosen seed of Israel's race,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Ye ransomed from the fall,
Hail Him who saves you by His grace.

Verse 3
Sinners, whose love can ne'er forget
The worm-wood and the gall,
The worm-wood and the gall,
Go, spread your trophies at His feet

Verse 4
Let ev'ry kindred and ev'ry tribe,
On this terrestrial ball,
On this terrestrial ball,
To Him all majesty ascribe.

Verse 5
O that with yonder sacred throng,
We at His feet may fall,
We at His feet may fall !
We'll join the everlasting song.
