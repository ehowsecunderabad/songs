Song 33 - O, worship the King

Verse 1
O, worship the King,
all-glorious above;
O, gratefully sing
His power and His love;
Our Shield and defender,
the Ancient of Days,
Pavilioned in splendour,
and girded with praise.

Verse 2
O, tell of His might,
O, sing of His grace,
Whose robe is the light,
whose canopy space;
His chariots of wrath
the deep thunderclouds form,
And dark is His path
on the wings of the storm.

Verse 3
The earth with its store
of wonders untold,
Almighty, Thy power
hath founded of old,
Hath stablished it fast
by a changeless decree,
And round it hath cast,
like a mantle, the sea.

Verse 4
Thy bountiful care
What tongue can recite?
It breathes in the air,
It shines in the light;
It streams from the hills,
It descends to the plain,
And sweetly distills
In the dew and the rain.

Verse 5
Frail children of dust,
And feeble as frail,
In Thee do we trust,
Nor find Thee to fail;
Thy mercies, how tender!
How firm to the end!
Our Maker, Defender,
Redeemer, and Friend!
