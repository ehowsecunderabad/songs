Song 356 - Father bring together

Father bring together,
The church that bears Your name,
Fill us with the passion,
To proclaim that Jesus reigns.
Pour oil on our prayers,
And let Your Spirit come.
We'll fight against the darkness,
Don't let the flame die down.

For the Church stands before you,
in worship,
Prayers burning bright
across the sky.
And Lord we want to burn,
not just lickering flame,
But to be wholly consumed
in Your name.
