Song 77 - Away in a manger,

Verse 1
Away in a manger, no crib for a bed
The little Lord Jesus laid down His
sweet head
The stars in the bright sky looked
down where He lay,
The little Lord Jesus asleep
on the hay.

Verse 2
The cattle are lowing,
the Baby awakes,
But little Lord Jesus,
no crying He makes.
I love Thee, Lord Jesus!
Look down from the sky,
And stay by my side
until morning is night

Verse 3
Be near me, Lord Jesus;
I ask Thee to stay
Close by me for ever, and love me,
I pray.
Bless all the dear children in
Thy tender care.
And fit us for heaven to live with
Thee there.
