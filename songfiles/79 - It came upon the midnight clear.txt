Song 79 - It came upon the midnight clear

Verse 1
It came upon the midnight clear
That glorious song of old;
From angels bending near the earth
To touch their harps of gold:
Peace on the earth, goodwill to men
From heaven's all-gracious King
The world in solemn stillness lay
To hear the angels sing.

Verse 2
Still through the cloven skies they come
With peaceful wings unfurled;
And still their heavenly music floats
O'er all the weary world:
Above its sad and lowly plains
They bend on hovering wing,
And ever, o'er its Babel-sounds,
The blessed angels sing.

Verse 3
O ye, beneath life's crushing load
Whose forms are bending low,
Who toil along the climbing way
With painful steps and slow;
Look up ! For glad and golden hours
Come swiftly on the wing;
O, rest beside the weary road,
And hear the angels sing!

Verse 4
For lo! The days are hastening on,
By prophet-bards foretold,
When, with the ever-circling years,
Comes round the age of gold;
When peace shall over all the earth
Its ancient splendours fling,
And the whole world send back
the song
Which now the angels sing!
