Song 252 - For I'm building a people

For I'm building a people of power
And I'm making a people of praise,
Who will move through this land by My
Spirit.
And will glorify My precious Name.
So build Your Church, Lord!
Make it strong, Lord!
Join our hearts Lord
Through Your Son.
Make us one, Lord, In Your Body.
In the Kingdom of your Son!
