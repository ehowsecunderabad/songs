Song 31 - O, for a thousand

Verse 1
O, for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise!
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.

Verse 2
My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth
abroad, The honors of Thy Name.

Verse 3
Jesus! The Name that charms
our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease,
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life and health and peace.

Verse 4
He breaks the power of cancelled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

Verse 5
He speaks and listening to His voice,
New life the dead receive;
The mournful broken hearts rejoice;
The humble poor believe.

Verse 6
Hear Him, ye deaf: His praise, ye
dumb,
Your loosened tongues employ;
Ye blind, behold your Saviour come;
And leap, ye lame for joy!
