Song 262 - I just keep trusting my Lord

I just keep trusting my Lord
As I walk along
I just keep trusting my Lord
And he gives me a song
Tho' the storm clouds darken the sky
O'er the heavenly trail
I just keep trusting my Lord
He will never fail
He is a faithful friend,
Such a faithful friend
I'll count on Him to the very end,
Tho' the storm clouds darken the sky
O'er the heavenly trail
I just keep trusting my Lord,
He will never fail.
