Song 378 - Lord I want to be Holy

Lord I want to be Holy
Holy in all that I do,
Lord I want to be Holy,
And to give the glory to You.
Lord I want to be faithful,
Faithful in all that I do,
Lord I want to be faithful,
And to give the glory to You.
Lord I want to be a servant,
Servant in all that I do,
Lord I want to be a servant,
And to give the glory to You.
