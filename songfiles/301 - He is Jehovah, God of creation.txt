Song 301 - He is Jehovah, God of creation

He is Jehovah, God of creation
He is Jehovah, Lord God Almighty
The balm of Gilead, the Rock of ages
He is Jehovah the God that healeth thee
Sing Hallelujah (4)
He is the great I am
The God of Abraham
Jehovah Shalom the God of peace I am
The God of Israel, The Everlasting One
He is Jehovah the God that healeth thee
