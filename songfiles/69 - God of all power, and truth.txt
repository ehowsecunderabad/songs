Song 69 - God of all power, and truth

Verse 1
God of all power, and truth, and grace,
Which shall from age to age endure,
Whose word, when heaven and
earth shall pass,
Remains and stands for ever sure;

Verse 2
That I Thy mercy may proclaim,
That all mankind Thy truth may see,
Hallow Thy great and glorious name,
And perfect holiness in me.

Verse 3
Purge me from every evil blot;
My idols all be cast aside;
Cleanse me from every sinful thought,
From all the filth of self and pride.

Verse 4
Give me a new, a perfect heart,
From doubt, and fear, and sorrow free
The mind which was in Christ impart,
And let my spirit cleave to Thee.

Verse 5
O that I now, from sin released,
Thy word may to the utmost prove,
Enter into the promised rest,
The Canaan of Thy perfect love!
Amen.
