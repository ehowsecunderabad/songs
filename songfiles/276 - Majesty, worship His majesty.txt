Song 276 - Majesty, worship His majesty

Majesty, worship His majesty,
Unto Jesus be all glory,
honour and praise
Majesty, kingdom authority,
Flows from His throne,
Unto His own, His anthem raise.
So exalt, lift up on high,
The Name of Jesus,
Magnify, come glorify,
Christ Jesus the King,
Majesty, worship His majesty,
Jesus who died, now glorified,
King of all kings.
