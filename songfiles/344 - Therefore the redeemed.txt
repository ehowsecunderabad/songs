Song 344 - Therefore the redeemed

Therefore the redeemed of the Lord
shall return,
And come with singing unto Zion;
And everlasting joy shall be upon
their head.
They shall obtain gladness and joy,
And sorrow and mourning shall flee
away.
Therefore the redeemed of the Lord
shall return,
And come with singing unto Zion;
And everlasting joy shall be upon
their head.
