Song 170 - Standing on the promises of

Standing on the promises of
Christ my King,
Thro' eternal ages
Let His praises ring;
Glory in the highest,
I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

Chorus 1
Standing, standing,
Standing on the promises of
God my Saviour;
Standing, standing,
I'm standing on
The promises of God.

Verse 2
Standing on the promises
That cannot fail,
When the howling storms
Of doubt and fear assail,
By the living word
Of God I shall prevail.
Standing on the promises of God.

Verse 3
Standing on the promises
Of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally
By love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily
With the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the Promises of God.

Verse 4
Standing on the promises
I can not fall
Listening every moment
To the Spirits call,
Resting in my Saviour,
As my all in all,
Standing on the promises of God.
