Song 314 - In God's green pastures feeding

In God's green pastures feeding,
By His cool waters lie,
Soft in the evening, walk my Lord
and I,
All the sheep of His pastures fare,
So wondrously fine. His sheep am I.
Waters cool-In the valley,
Pastures green-On the mountain,
In the evening ' Walk my Lord and I.
Dark the night-In the valley,
Rough the way-On the mountain,
Step by step my Lord and I.
In God's great love rejoicing
By His grace and His power
Great is the love
Walk with my Lord and I
All my life I will love and serve Him
Down herebelow
His child am I
