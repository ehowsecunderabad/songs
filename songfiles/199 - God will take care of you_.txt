Song 199 - God will take care of you:

God will take care of you:
All through the day
Jesus is near you to keep you from ill:
Walking or resting,
At work or at play,
Jesus is with you,
And watching you still.

Verse 2
He will take care of you:
All through the night
Jesus, the Shepherd,
His little one keeps;
Darkness to Him is the same
as the light;
He never slumbers,
And He never sleeps.

Verse 3
He will take care of you:
All through the year
Crowning each day with
His kindness and love,
Sending you blessings,
And shielding from fear.
Leading you on to the bright
Home above.

Verse 4
He will take care of you:
Yes, to the end:
Nothing can alter
His love for His own
Children, be glad that you have
Such a Friend:
He will not leave you
One moment alone.
