Song 265 - I will sing of the mercies

I will sing of the mercies of the
Lord for ever,
I will sing, I will sing.
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord for
ever,
I will sing of the mercies of the Lord.
With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness.
With my mouth will I make known
Thy faithfulness to all generations
(Repeat first 4 lines)
