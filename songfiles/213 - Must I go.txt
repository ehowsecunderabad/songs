Song 213 - Must I go

'Must I go, and empty handed,''
Thus my dear Redeemer, meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His-feet?

Chorus 1
'Must I go, and empty handed?''
Must I meet my Saviour so?
Not one soul with which to greet
Him;
Must I empty handed go?

Verse 2
Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Saviour saves me now;
But to meet Him empty handed,
Tho't of that now clouds my brow.

Verse 3
O the years in sinning wasted,
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Saviour,
To His will I'd gladly bow.

Verse 4
O ye saints, arouse, be earnest;
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'er take thee,
Strive for souls while still you may.
