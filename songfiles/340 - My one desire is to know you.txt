Song 340 - My one desire is to know you

My one desire is to know You more
To open up my heart and let You pour,
In to my life what I've been longing for,
My one desire is to know You, Lord.
Oh Lord, there's a crying out in me.
Come and set my spirit free,
I really want to know You,
Cleanse my mind and change my heart,
Help me make a brand new start,
I surrender to Your will.
My one desire is to serve You, Lord,
To open up my heart and let You pour,
Into my life what I've been longing for,
My one desire is to serve You, Lord.
