Song 65 - Holy Father in Thy mercy

Verse 1
Holy Father in Thy mercy,
Hear our humble prayer;
Keep our loved ones, now far
distant, neath Thy care.

Verse 2
Jesus, Saviour, let Thy presence
Be their light and guide;
Keep, O keep them, in their weakness,
At Thy side.

Verse 3
When in sorrow, when in danger,
When in loneliness,
In Thy love look down and comfort
In distress.

Verse 4
May the joy of Thy salvation
Be their strength and stay;
May they love and may they praise
Thee Day by day.

Verse 5
Holy Spirit, let Thy teaching
sanctify their life;
Send Thy grace that they may conquer,
In the strife.

Verse 6
Father, Son, and Holy Spirit,
God, the One in Three,
Bless them, guide them, save and
keep them, Near to Thee.
