Song 377 - Jesus You're the sweetest name

Jesus You're the sweetest name of all
Jesus, You always hear me when I call,
Oh, Jesus, You died and took away my shame,
You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

Jesus, how I love to praise Your name,
Jesus, You're still the First, the Last, the same,
Oh, Jesus, You died and took away my shame,
You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.

Jesus, You're the soon and coming King,
Jesus we need the love that You can bring,
Oh, Jesus, we lift our voices up and sing,
You're the sweetest, the sweetest name of all.
