Song 362 - God will make a way

God will make a way,
where there seems to be no way
He works in ways we cannot see,
He will make a way for me
He will be my Guide,
hold me closely to His side
With love and strength for each
new day
He will make a way,
He will make a way
By a roadway in the wilderness,
He'll lead me
And rivers in the desert will I see
Heaven and earth will fade,
but His word will still remain
He will do something new today.
