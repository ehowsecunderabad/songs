Song 312 - Come on and Celebrate,

Come on and Celebrate,
His gift of love we will celebrate,
The Son of God who loved us,
And gave us life.
We'll shout Your praise, O King,
You give us joy nothing else can
bring,
We give to You our offering
In celebration praise.
Come on and celebrate, celebrate,
Celebrate and sing,
Celebrate and sing to the King,
Come on and celebrate, celebrate,
Celebrate and sing,
Celebrate and sing to the King.
