Song 128 - Beyond the sunset

Verse 1
Beyond the sunset,
O blissful morning,
When with our Saviour heav'n is begun.
Earth's toiling ended,
O glorious dawning;
Beyond the sunset,
when day is done.

Verse 2
Beyond the sunset,
no clouds will gather,
No storms will threaten,
no fears annoy;
O day of gladness, O day unending;
Beyond the sunset, eternal joy!

Verse 3
Beyond the sunset,
a hand will guide me,
To God, the Father, whom I adore;
His glorious presence,
His words of welcome,
Will be my portion on that fair shore.

Verse 4
Beyond the sunset, O glad reunion,
With our dear loved ones
who've gone before;
In that fair homeland,
we'll know no parting,
Beyond the sunset forevermore!
