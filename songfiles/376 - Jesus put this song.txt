Song 376 - Jesus put this song

Jesus put this song into our hearts,
Jesus put this songs into our hearts.
It's a song of joy no one can take
away,
Jesus put this song into our heart.
Jesus taught us how to live in
harmony,
Jesus taught us how to live in harmony,
Different faces, different races,
He made us one,
Jesus taught us how to live
In harmony,
Jesus taught us how to be a family,
Jesus taught us how to be a family,
Loving one another with the
Love that He gives,
Jesus taught us how to be
A family,
Jesus turned our sorrow into dancing,
Jesus turned our sorrow into dancing,
Changed our tears of sadness into
rivers of joy,
Jesus turned our sorrow into Dancing,
