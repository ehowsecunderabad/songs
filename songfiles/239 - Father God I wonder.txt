Song 239 - Father God I wonder

Father God I wonder
How I manage to exist without
The knowledge of your parenthood
And your loving care;
But now I am your son
I'm adopted in your family
And I can never be alone
Cause Father God
You're there beside me
I will sing your praises
I will sing your praises
I will sing your praises
Forever more (repeat)
