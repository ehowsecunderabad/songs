Song 104 - Here, O my Lord, I see Thee

Verse 1
Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face
to face;
Here faith can touch and handle
things unseen;
Here would I grasp with firmer hand
Thy grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

Verse 2
Here would I feed upon the bread of God;
Here drink with Thee the royal
wine of heaven;
Here would I lay aside each earthly
load;
Here taste afresh the calm of sin
forgiven.

Verse 3
This is the hour of banquet and of
song;
This is the heavenly table spread
for me
Here let me feast, and feasting, still
prolong
The brief, bright hour of fellowship
with Thee.

Verse 4
Too soon we rise, the symbols
disappear;
The feast, though not the love, is
past and gone;
The bread and wine remove, but Thou
art here.
Nearer than ever, still our Shield
and Sun.

Verse 5
Feast after feast thus comes and
passes by,
Yet passing points to the glad feast
above;
Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,
The Lamb's great bridal-feast of
bliss and love.
