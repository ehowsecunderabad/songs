Song 37 - Praise to the Lord, the Almighty

Verse 1
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty,
the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him,
for He is thy health and salvation,
All ye who hear, now to His temple
draw near;
Join me in glad adoration!

Verse 2
Praise to the Lord, who o'er all
things so wondrously reigneth
Shieldeth thee under His wings, yea,
so gently sustaineth!
Hast thou not seen how thy desires
e'er have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Verse 3
Praise to the Lord, who with
marvelous wisdom hath made thee!
Decked thee with health, and with
loving hand guided and stayed thee;
How oft in grief hath not
He brought thee relief,
Spreading His wings for to shade
thee!

Verse 4
Praise to the Lord, who doth
prosper thy work and defend thee;
Surely His goodness and
mercy here daily attend thee.
Ponder a new,
What the Almighty can do
If with His love He befriend thee

Verse 5
Praise to the Lord! O let all that is
in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come
now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen sound from His
people again:
Gladly for aye we adore Him.
