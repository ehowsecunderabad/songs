Song 138 - God sent His Son

God sent His Son, they called Him
Jesus,
He came to love, heal and forgive,
He bled and died to buy my pardon,
An empty grave is there to prove
My Saviour lives

Chorus 1
Because he lives, I can face tomorrow,
Because he lives, all fear is gone,
Because I know, He holds the future,
And life is worth the living
Just because He lives

Verse 2
How sweet to hold a new born baby,
And feel the pride and joy he brings,
But greater still the calm assurance,
This child can face uncertain days
Because He lives.

Verse 3
And then one day, I'll cross the river,
I'll fight life's final war with pain,
And then as death gives way to
victory
I'll see the lights of glory,
And I'll know, He lives.
