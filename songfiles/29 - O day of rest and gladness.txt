Song 29 - O day of rest and gladness

Verse 1
O day of rest and gladness,
O day of joy and light,
O balm of care and sadness,
Most beautiful, most bright:
To thee, the high and lowly,
Through ages joined in tune
Sing 'holy, holy, holy,''
to the great Three in One.

Verse 2
On Thee, at the creation,
The light first had its birth;
On Thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depth of earth;
On Thee, our Lord, victorious,
The Spirit sent from heaven;
And thus on Thee, most glorious;
a triple light was given.

Verse 3
Today on weary nations,
The heavenly manna falls;
To holy convocations,
The silver trumpet calls,
Where Gospel light is glowing,
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing,
With soul-refreshing streams.
