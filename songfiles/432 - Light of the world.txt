Song 432 - Light of the world

Light of the world
You stepped down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see
Beauty that made this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

Here I am to worship
Her I am to bow down
Here I am to say that You are my God
You are altogether lovely
You are altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days, oh! So highly
exalted
Glorious in heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You
created
All for love's sake became poor

I'll never know how much it cost
To see my sins upon the cross.
