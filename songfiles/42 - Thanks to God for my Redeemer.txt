Song 42 - Thanks to God for my Redeemer

Verse 1
Thanks to God for my Redeemer,
Thanks for all Thou dost provide!
Thanks for times now but a mem'ry
Thanks for Jesus by my side!
Thanks for pleasant, balmy spring
time,
Thanks for dark and dreary fall!
Thanks for tears by now forgotten,
Thanks for peace within my soul!

Verse 2
Thanks for prayers that Thou hast
answered,
Thanks for what Thou dost deny!
Thanks for storms that I have
weathered
Thanks for all Thou dost supply!
Thanks for pain, and thanks for pleasure,
Thanks for comfort in despair,
Thanks for grace that none can measure,
Thanks for love beyond compare!

Verse 3
Thanks for roses by the wayside,
Thanks for thorns their stems contain
Thanks for home and thanks for fireside,
Thanks for hope, that sweet refrain!
Thanks for joy and thanks for sorrow,
Thanks for heav'nly peace with
Thee!
Thanks for hope in the tomorrow,
Thanks thro' all eternity!
