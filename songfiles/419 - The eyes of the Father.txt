Song 419 - The eyes of the Father

The eyes of the Father run through to
and fro
He's searching the earth
He's looking for those
Who make intercession
On behalf of their nation
Those who will rise up and pray
We'll stand in the gap on behalf of our
land (2)
Down on our knees we'll take a stand
And there intercede for our land
We'll pray for the needs of our land
The powers of darkness releashed on
our land
Will never prevail, will never withstand
The deep intercessions by a people of
passion
Those who will rise up and pray
