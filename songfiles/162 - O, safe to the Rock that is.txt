Song 162 - O, safe to the Rock that is

O, safe to the Rock that is
Higher than I
My soul in its conflicts and
Sorrows would fly;
So sinful, so weary,
Thine Thine would I be;
Thou blest 'Rock of Ages,''
I'm hiding in Thee.

Chorus 1
Hiding in Thee,
Hiding in Thee,
Thou blest 'Rock of Ages,''
I'm hiding in Thee.

Verse 2
In the calm of the noontide,
In sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts
O'er me its power;
In the tempests of life,
On its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest 'Rock of Ages,''
I'm hiding in Thee.

Verse 3
How oft in the conflict,
when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and
breathed out my woe;
How often when trials like
sea-billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee,
O Thou Rock of my soul.
