Song 428 - Your light broke through my night

Your light broke through my night
Restored exceeding joy
Your grace fell like the rain
And made this desert live

You have turned
my mourning into dancing
You have turned 
my sorrows into Joy

Your hand has lifted me up
I stand on higher ground
Your praise rose in my heart
And made this valley sing

This is how we overcome.
