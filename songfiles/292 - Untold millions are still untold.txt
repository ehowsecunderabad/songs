Song 292 - Untold millions are still untold

Untold millions are still untold
Untold millions are outside the fold
Who will tell them of Jesus love
And the heavenly mansions awaiting
above
Jesus died on Calvary
To save each one from sin;
Now he's calling you and me
To go and bring them in
For many untold millions '.. etc.
