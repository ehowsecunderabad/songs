Song 4 - All glory, laud, and honour

Chorus 1
All glory, laud, and honour,
To Thee, Redeemer, King,
To whom the lips of children
Made sweet hosannas ring!

Verse 1
Thou art the King of Israel,
Thou David's royal Son,
who in the Lord's Name comest,
The King and blessed One,

Verse 2
The company of angels
Are praising Thee on high;
And mortal men, and all things
Created, make reply.

Verse 3
The people of the Hebrews
With palms before Thee went;
Our praise and prayer and anthems
Before Thee we present.

Verse 4
To Thee, before thy Passion,
They sang their hymns of praise;
To thee, now high exalted,
Our melody we raise.

Verse 5
Thou didst accept their praises;
Accept the praise we bring,
Who in all good delightest,
Thou good and gracious King.
