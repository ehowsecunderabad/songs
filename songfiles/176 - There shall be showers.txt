Song 176 - There shall be showers

There shall be showers of blessing;
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Saviour above.

Chorus 1
Showers of blessing,
Showers of blessing we need;
Mercy drops round us are falling,
But for the showers we plead.

Verse 2
There shall be showers of blessing;
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

Verse 3
There shall be showers of blessing;
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing:
Come, and now honour Thy word.

Verse 4
There shall be showers of blessing;
Oh, that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!
