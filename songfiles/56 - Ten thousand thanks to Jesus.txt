Song 56 - Ten thousand thanks to Jesus

Verse 1
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Whose life our ransom paid,
Whose blood a full atonement
For all the world has made:
Let every heart adore Him,
Let ev'ry creature sing
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,
Our Saviour and our King.

Chorus 1
Ten thousand thanks,
ten thousand thanks,
We'll praise Him o'er and o'er;
And for the life with Him to live,
Ten thousand, thousand more.

Verse 2
Ten thousand hearts to Jesus
How gladly would we give;
Ten thousand lives to Jesus,
Had we so long to live:
Ten thousand tongues shall praise Him,
Ten thousand songs ascend
To Him, our blest Redeemer,
To Him, our dearest Friend.

Verse 3
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus
For blessing's ev'ry hour;
Ten thousands times ten thousands,
For love's redeeming pow'r:
And when we hear His welcome
Beyond the rolling sea,
His love thro' endless ages
Our sweetest song shall be.
