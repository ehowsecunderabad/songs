Song 420 - The Lord is marching

The Lord is marching out in
splendour,
In awesome majesty He rides,
For truth, humility and justice,
His majesty army fills the skies.
O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love endures.
O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love endures,
O give thanks to the Lord,
For His love endures,
Forever (2)
His army marches on with dancing,
For He has filled our hearts with joy.
Be glad the kingdom is advancing,
The love of God, our battle cry!
