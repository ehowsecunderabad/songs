Song 387 - O the gates of hell

O the gates of hell shall not prevail,
Against the army of the Lord;
As we march along we sing a song,
Of the one who sets us free;
As we use God's Word, like a twoedged
sword,
Against the enemy.
Emmanuel, we're marching in your
Name,
Emmanuel, the Lamb that was slain,
Emmanuel, is risen again;
Emmanuel, Emmanuel, Emmanuel,
He is Lord.
