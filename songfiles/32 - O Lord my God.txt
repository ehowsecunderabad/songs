Song 32 - O Lord my God

Verse 1
O Lord my God,
when I in awesome wonder,
Consider all the works
Thy hand hath made;
I see the stars,
I hear the mighty thunder,
Thy power throughout
the universe displayed.

Chorus 1
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art. (Repeat)

Verse 2
When through the woods
and forest glades I wander,
And hear the birds
sing sweetly in the trees,
When I look down
from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook
and feel the gentle breeze.

Chorus 1
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art. (Repeat)

Verse 3
But when I think that God,
His Son not sparing,
Sent Him to die,
I scarce can take it in,
That on the cross,
My burden gladly bearing,
He bled and died
To take away my sin;

Chorus 1
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art. (Repeat)

Verse 4
When Christ shall come,
With shout of acclamation,
And take me home -
What joy shall fill my heart,
Then shall I bow
In humble adoration,
And there proclaim,
My God, how great Thou art!

Chorus 1
Then sings my soul
My Saviour God to Thee,
How great Thou art,
How great Thou art. (Repeat)
