Song 107 - Jesus hath died and hath risen

Verse 1
Jesus hath died and hath risen again,
Pardon and peace to bestow;
Fully I trust Him, from sin's guilty
stain
Jesus saves me now.

Chorus 1
Jesus saves me now!
Jesus saves me now!
Yes, Jesus saves me all the time,
Jesus saves me now!

Verse 2
Sin's condemnation is over and gone,
Jesus alone knoweth how
Life and salvation my soul hath put on
Jesus saves me now.

Verse 3
Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin,
Satan to Jesus must bow,
Therefore I triumph without and within
Jesus saves me now.

Verse 4
Sorrow and pain may beset me about
Nothing can darken my brow,
Battling in faith I can joyfully shout,
Jesus saves me now.
