Song 130 - Breathe on me, Breath of God

Verse 1
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Fill me with life anew,
That I may love what Thou dost love
And do what That wouldst do.

Verse 2
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Until my heart is pure,
Until with Thee I will one will,
To do and to endure.

Verse 3
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
Till I am wholly Thine,
Till all this earthly part of me
Glows with Thy fire divine.

Verse 4
Breathe on me, Breath of God,
So shall I never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity.
