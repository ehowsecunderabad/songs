Song 26 - Mine eyes

Verse 1
Mine eyes have seen the glory
Of the coming of the Lord;
He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored
He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword;
His truth is marching on

Chorus 1
Glory! Glory!, Hallelujah
Glory! Glory!, Hallelujah
Glory! Glory!, Hallelujah
His truth is marching on.

Verse 2
He has sounded forth the trumpet
That shall never call retreat,
He is sifting out the hearts of men
before the judgment seat;
Be swift my soul, to answer Him
Be jubilant my feet
Our God is marching on

Verse 3
In the beauty of the lilies Christ was
born across the sea,
With a glory in His bosom that
transfigures you and me,
As He died to make men holy,
Let us die to make men free;
While God is marching on.
