Song 188 - In heavenly love abiding

In heavenly love abiding,
No change my heart shall fear;
And safe in such confiding,
For nothing changes here;
The storm may roar about me,
My heart may low be laid.
But God is round about me,
And can I be dismayed?

Verse 2
Wherever He may guide me,
No want shall turn me back;
My shepherd is beside me,
And nothing can I lack.
His wisdom ever waketh,
His sight is never dim;
He knows the way He taketh,
And I will walk with Him.

Verse 3
Green pastures are before me,
Which yet I have not seen;
Where the dark clouds have been.
My hope I cannot measure,
My hope I cannot measure,
My Saviour has my treasure,
And he will walk with me.
