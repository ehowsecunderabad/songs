Song 227 - Shepherd of my Soul

Shepherd of my Soul
I give you full control
Where ever you may lead
I will follow
I have made a choice
To listen to your voice
Where ever you may lead
I will go
Be it in a quiet pasture
Or by a gentle stream
The Shepherd of my soul
Is by my side
Should I face a mighty Mountain
Or a valley dark and deep
The Shepherd of my soul
Will be my Guide
