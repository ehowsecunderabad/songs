Song 6 - And can it be that I should gain

Verse 1
And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love ! How can it be
That Thou, my God,
should'st die for me?
Amazing love ! How can it be
That Thou, my God, should'st die
for me?

Verse 2
He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race;
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

Verse 3
No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ
my own.
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ
my own.

Verse 4
Long my imprisoned spirit lay;
Fast bound in sin and nature's night,
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light,
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee
My chains fell off, my heart was free
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee
