Song 359 - For this purpose Christ

For this purpose Christ was revealed
To destroy all the works of the Evil one.
Christ in us has overcome, so with
gladness we sing
And welcome His kingdom in.

Over sin He has conquer'd,
Hallelujah, he has conquer'd
Over death victorious,
Hallelujah, victorious.
Over sickness He has triumph'd,
Hallelujah, He has triumph'd.
Jesus reigns over all!

In the name of Jesus we stand,
By the power of His blood
We now claim this ground.
Satan has no authority here,
Power of darkness must flee,
For Christ has the victory.
