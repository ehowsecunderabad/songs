Song 66 - Abba, Father! we approach Thee

Verse 1
Abba, Father! we approach Thee
In our Saviour's precious Name;
We, Thy children, here assembling
Access to Thy presence claim.
From our sin His blood hath washed us;
'Tis through Him our souls draw near
And Thy Spirit, too, hath taught us,
'Abba, Father!'' Name so dear.

Verse 2
Once as prodigals we wandered,
In our folly, far from Thee;
But Thy grace, o'er sin abounding,
Rescued us from misery.
Thou the prodigals hast pardoned
Loved us with a Father's love;
Welcomed us with joy o'er flowing,
E'en to dwell with Thee above.

Verse 3
Clothed in garments of salvation,
At Thy table is our place;
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,
In the riches of Thy grace,
'It is meet'' we hear Thee saying,
'We should merry be and glad;
I have found My once lost children,
Now they live, who once were
dead.''

Verse 4
Abba, Father! All adore Thee,
All rejoice in heaven above;
While in us they learn the wonders
Of Thy wisdom, power, and love.
Soon, before Thy throne assembled,
All Thy children shall proclaim,
'Glory, everlasting glory,
Be to God and to the Lamb!''
