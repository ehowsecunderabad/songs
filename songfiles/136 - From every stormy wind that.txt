Song 136 - From every stormy wind that

From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat;
'Tis found beneath the mercy-seat.

Verse 2
There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet;
It is the blood-bo't mercy-seat.

Verse 3
There is a scene where spirits blend,
where friend holds fellowship
with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy-seat.

Verse 4
There, there on eagle-wing we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more
And heaven comes down our souls
to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy-seat.
