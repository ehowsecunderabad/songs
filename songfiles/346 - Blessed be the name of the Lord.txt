Song 346 - Blessed be the name of the Lord

Blessed be the name of the Lord
Blessed be the name of the Lord!
Blessed be the name of the Lord most
high!
The name of the Lord is a strong
tower!
The righteous run into it and they are
saved! (2)
Glory to the name of the Lord!. . . .
Holy is the name of the Lord!. . . . .
Honor to the name of the Lord!. . . .
