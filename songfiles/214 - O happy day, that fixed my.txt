Song 214 - O happy day, that fixed my

O happy day, that fixed my choice,
On Thee, my Saviour and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

Chorus 1
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away:
He taught me how to watch and pray
And live rejoicing every day.
Happy day, happy day,
When Jesus washed my sins away.

Verse 2
O happy bond, that seals my vows,
To Him who merits all my love!
Let cheerful anthems fill His house,
While to that sacred shrine I move.

Verse 3
'Tis done! The great transaction's done!
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me and I followed on,
Charmed to confess the voice divine.

Verse 4
Now rest, my long-divided heart;
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Here I have found a nobler part,
Here heavenly pleasures fill my breast

Verse 5
High heav'n, that heard the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear,
Till in life's latest hour I bow,
And bless in death a bond so dear.
