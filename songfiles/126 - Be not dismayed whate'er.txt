Song 126 - Be not dismayed whate'er

Be not dismayed whate'er betide,
God will take care of you;
Beneath His wings of love abide,
God will take care of you.

Chorus 1
God will take care of you,
Through ev'ry day, o'er all the way;
He will take care of you,
God will take care of you.

Verse 2
Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you;
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you.

Verse 3
All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you;
Nothing you ask will be denied,
God will take care of you.

Verse 4
No matter what may be the test
God will take care of you;
Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you.
