Song 123 - It may be at morn, when the day

Verse 1
It may be at morn, when the day
is awaking,
When sunlight through darkness and
shadow is
breaking,
That Jesus will come in the fullness
of glory,
To receive from the world His own.

Chorus 1
O, Lord Jesus, how long?
How long ere we shout the glad song?
Christ returneth, Hallelujah!
Hallelujah! Amen.
Hallelujah! Amen.

Verse 2
It may be at midday, it may be at
twilight,
It may be, perchance, at the blackness
of midnight
Will burst into light in the blaze of
His glory,
When Jesus receives 'His own.''

Verse 3
While its hosts cry 'Hosanna!'' from
heaven descending,
With glorified saints and
the angels attending,
With grace on His brow,
like a halo of glory,
Will Jesus receive 'His own.''

Verse 4
Oh, joy! Oh, delight!
Should we go without dying;
No sickness, no sadness, no dread, and
no crying;
Caught up through the clouds with
our Lord into glory,
When Jesus receives 'His own.''
