Song 134 - Down in the valley

Down in the valley with my Saviour I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and
the sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would
follow, follow on:
Walking in His footsteps till the crown
be won.

Chorus 1
Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus;
Anywhere, everywhere,
I would follow on!
Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus;
Everywhere He leads me
I would follow on!

Verse 2
Down in the valley with my Saviour
I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and
the dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never,
never fear;
Danger cannot harm me if my Lord is
near.

Verse 3
Down in the valley or upon the
mountain steep,
Close beside my Saviour would my
soul ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that
He has trod,
Up to where they gather on the hills of
God.
