Song 57 - This, this is the God we adore

Verse 1
This, this is the God we adore,
Our faithful, unchangeable Friend;
Whose love is as great as His power,
And neither knows measure nor end.

Verse 2
'Tis Jesus, the first and the last,
Whose Spirit shall guide us safe home
We'll praise Him for all that is past,
And trust Him for all that's to come
