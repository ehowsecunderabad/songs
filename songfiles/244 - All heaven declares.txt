Song 244 - All heaven declares

All heaven declares
The glory of the risen Lord.
Who can compare
With the beauty of the Lord?
Forever He will be
The Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow my knee
And worship Him alone.

I will proclaim
The glory of the risen Lord.
Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God.
Forever You will be
The Lamb upon the throne.
I gladly bow my knee
And worship You alone.
