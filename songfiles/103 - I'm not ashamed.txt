Song 103 - I'm not ashamed

Verse 1
I'm not ashamed to own my Lord,
Or to defend His cause,
Maintain the honour of His Word,
The glory of His cross.

Chorus 1
At the cross! At the cross!
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart
rolled away;
It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

Verse 2
Jesus, my God! I know His Name
His name is all my trust;
Nor will He put my soul to shame,
Nor let my hope be lost.

Chorus 1
At the cross! At the cross!
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart
rolled away;
It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

Verse 3
Firm as His throne His promise stands,
And He can well secure
What I've committed to His hands,
Till the decisive hour.

Chorus 1
At the cross! At the cross!
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart
rolled away;
It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!

Verse 4
Then will He own my worthless name
Before His Father's face;
And, in the new Jerusalem,
Appoint my soul a place.

Chorus 1
At the cross! At the cross!
Where I first saw the light,
And the burden of my heart
rolled away;
It was there by faith
I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day!
