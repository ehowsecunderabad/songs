Song 67 - May the Lord hear

Verse 1
May the Lord hear thee in the day
When trouble shall befall;
And let the name of Jacob's God
Defend thee from all ill.

Verse 2
And from His holy sanctuary,
May He send help to thee,
And from the stores of Zion's hill
Let him give strength to thee.

Verse 3
Let him remember all thy gifts,
Accept thy sacrifice;
And may God grant thee all thy heart,
And every counsel wise.

Verse 4
In thy salvation we'll rejoice;
In our God's name we will
Display our banners: and the Lord
Thy every prayer fulfil

Verse 5
Know that the Lord will surely save
His own anointed one;
The saving strength of his right hand
From heaven will be sent down.

Verse 6
Some put their trust in chariots
And some in horses vain.
But we will still remember well
The Lord our great God's name!

Verse 7
We rise and upright stand, while they
Are brought right down and fall.
Save us, O Lord, and let the King
Attend us when we call.
