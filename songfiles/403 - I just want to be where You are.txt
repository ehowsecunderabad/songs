Song 403 - I just want to be where You are

I just want to be where You are,
Dwelling daily in Your presence,
I don't want to worship from afar,
Draw me near to where You are.
In your dwelling place forever,
Take me to the place where You are,
I just want to be with You.
I want to be where You are, Dwelling
in Your presence.
Feasting at Your table, Surrounded by
Your glory.
In Your presence, that's where I
always want to be.
I just want to be, I just want to be with
You.
O my God, You are my strength and
my song
When I'm in Your presence
Though I'm weak You're always strong.
