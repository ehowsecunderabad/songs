Song 110 - There's a land that is fairer

Verse 1
There's a land that is fairer than
day,
And by faith we can see it afar;
For the Father awaits over the way,
To prepare us a dwelling place
there.

Chorus 1
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful
shore;
In the sweet by and by,
We shall meet on that beautiful
shore.

Verse 2
We shall sing on that beautiful shore,
The melodious songs of the blest,
And our spirits shall sorrow no more,
Not a sigh for the blessing of rest.

Verse 3
To our bountiful Father above,
We will offer our tribute of praise,
For the glorious gift of His love,
And the blessings that hallow our
days.
