Song 52 - O Thou whose hand

Verse 1
O Thou whose hand hath brought us
Unto this joyful day,
Accept our glad thanks giving,
And listen as we pray;
And may our preparation
For this day's service be
With one accord to offer
Ourselves, O Lord, to Thee.

Verse 2
For this new house we praise Thee,
Reared at Thine own command,
For every generous bosom,
And every willing hand;
And now within Thy temple
Thy glory let us see,
For all its strength and beauty
Are nothing without Thee.

Verse 3
And oft as here we gather,
And hearts in worship blend,
May truth reveal its power,
And fervent prayer ascend;
Here may the busy toiler
Rise to the things above,
The young, the old, be strengthened,
And all men learn Thy love.

Verse 4
And as the years roll onward,
And strong affections twine,
And tender memories gather
About this sacred shrine,
May this its chiefest honour,
Its glory, ever be,
That multitudes within it
Have found their way to Thee.

Verse 5
Lord God, our fathers' helper,
Our joy, and hope, and stay,
Grant now a gracious earnest
Of many a coming day.
Our yearning hearts Thou knowest;
We wait before Thy throne;
O come, and by Thy presence
Make this new house Thine own.
Amen.
