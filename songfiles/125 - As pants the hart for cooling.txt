Song 125 - As pants the hart for cooling

Verse 1
As pants the hart for cooling streams,
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.

Verse 2
For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
O when shall I behold Thy face,
Thou Majesty divine!

Verse 3
God of my strength, how long shall I
Like one forgotten, mourn?
Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed,
To my oppressor's scorn.

Verse 4
Why restless, why cast down, my soul,
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.
