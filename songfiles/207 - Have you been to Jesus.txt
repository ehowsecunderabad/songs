Song 207 - Have you been to Jesus

Have you been to Jesus
For the cleansing power?
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in
His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?

Chorus 1
Are you washed' in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless?
Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?

Verse 2
Are you walking daily by
The Saviour's side?
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment
In the Crucified?
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?

Verse 3
When the Bridegroom comes,
Will your robes be white?
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?
Will your soul be ready for
The mansions bright,
And be washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?

Verse 4
Lay aside the garments
That are stained with sin,
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?
There's a fountain flowing for
The soul unclean,
Are you washed in the blood
Of the Lamb?
