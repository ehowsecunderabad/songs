Song 397 - Father, here we come

Father, here we come,
To worship and adore You,
Father, here we are,
To praise and glorify You
With joy our hearts we bring
With love our song we sing
We come to you in faith,
We stand here unafraid.
To You we lift our voice,
In You Lord we rejoice,
We want to see Your face
And be filled with Your grace
O come with us dear friends
Your life for Him do spend
O come give Him your all ,
And hear His loving call.
