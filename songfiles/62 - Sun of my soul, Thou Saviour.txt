Song 62 - Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour

Verse 1
Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near:
Oh, may no earth-born cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant'seyes

Verse 2
When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep:
Be my last thought, how sweet to rest
For ever on my Saviour's breast!

Verse 3
Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

Verse 4
Be near to bless me when I wake,
Ere thro' the world my way I take;
Till, in the ocean of Thy love,
I lose myself in heaven above.
