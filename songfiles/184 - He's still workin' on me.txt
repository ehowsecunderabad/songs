Song 184 - He's still workin' on me

He's still workin' on me
To make me what I ought to be
It took him just a week
To make the moon and stars
The Sun and the Earth and
Jupiter and Mars
How loving and patient He must be!
He's still workin' on me

Verse 1
There really ought to be
A sign upon my heart
'Don't judge Him yet,
There's an unfinished part'
(But) I'll be perfect
Just according to His plan,
Fashioned by the Master's
Loving hand.

Verse 2
The mirror of His Word,
Reflections that I see,
Makes me wonder why
He never gave up on me
He loves me as I am
And helps me when I pray
Remember! He's the Potter
I'm the clay
