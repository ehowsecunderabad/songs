Song 223 - Years I spent in vanity and pride

Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was Crucified,
Knowing not it was for me
He died On Calvary.

Chorus 1
Mercy there was great,
And grace was free;
Pardon there was multiplied to me;
There my burdened soul found
liberty, at Calvary.

Verse 2
By God's Word at last my sin I
learned;
Then I trembled at the law I'd
spurned
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary.

Verse 3
Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can
Only sing of Calvary.

Verse 4
Oh, the love that drew salvation's
plan!
Oh, the grace that bro't it
down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that
God did span At Calvary!
