Song 299 - You are my strength

You are my strength when I am weak,
You are the treasure that I seek,
You are my all in all!
Seeking you as a precious jewel
Lord to give up I'd be a fool
You are my all in all!
Jesus, Lamb of God,
Worthy is Your name!
Jesus, Lamb of God,
Worthy is Your name!
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame
Lord, I just want to bless Your name,
You are my all in all!
When I fall down You pick me up,
When I am dry You fill my cup,
You are my all in all!
