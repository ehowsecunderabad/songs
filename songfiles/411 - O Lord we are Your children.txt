Song 411 - O Lord we are Your children

O Lord we are Your children
O Lord we are Your children...
Chosen and called by Your name
With one heart and purpose we gather
To glorify You and proclaim
That You Lord are a sure foundation
We will not be afraid
When the storm comes in we will not be
shaken
For by Your hand we are saved
O by Your hand we are saved.
