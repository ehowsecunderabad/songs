Song 51 - What shall I render to my God

Verse 1
What shall I render to my God
For all His mercy's store?
I'll take the gifts He hath bestowed,
And humbly ask for more.

Verse 2
The sacred cup of saving grace
I will with thanks receive,
And all His promises embrace,
And to His glory live.

Verse 3
My vows I will to His great name
Before His people pay,
And all I have, and all I am,
Upon His altar lay.

Verse 4
Thy lawful servant, Lord, I owe
To Thee whate'er is mine,
Born in Thy family below,
And by redemption Thine.

Verse 5
Thy hands created me, Thy hands
From sin have set me free,
Thy mercy that hath loosed my bands
Hath bound me fast to Thee.

Verse 6
The God of all-redeeming grace
My God I will proclaim,
Offer the sacrifice of praise,
And call upon His name.

Verse 7
Praise Him, ye saints, the God of love,
Who hath my sins forgiven,
Till, gathered to the church above,
We sing the songs of heaven.
