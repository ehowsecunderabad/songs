Song 322 - Through our God

Through our God, we shall do
valiantly,
It is He who will tread down our
enemies,
We'll sing and shout His victory,
Christ is King!
For God has won the victory, and set His
people free,
His word has slain the enemy, the earth
shall stand and that see.
That through.......King (repeat)
Christ is King! Christ is King! Christ is
King!
