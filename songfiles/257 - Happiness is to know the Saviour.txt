Song 257 - Happiness is to know the Saviour

Happiness is to know the Saviour
Living a life within His favour
Having a change in my behaviour,
Happiness in the Lord,
Real joy is mine,
No matter if tear drops start;
I found the secret,
It's Jesus in my heart., hallelujah
Happiness is a new creation,
Jesus and me in close relation,
Having a part in His salvation,
Happiness is the Lord!
Happiness is to be forgiven,
Living a life that's worth the living
Taking a trip that leads to heaven
Happiness is the Lord!
