Song 222 - Wonderful grace of Jesus,

Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Greater than all my sin;
How shall my tongue describe it,
Where shall its praise begin?
Taking away my burden,
Setting my spirit free;..
For the wonderful grace of
Jesus reaches me.

Chorus 1
Wonderful the matchless grace of
Jesus,
Deeper than the mighty rolling sea;
Higher than the mountain,
sparkling like a fountain,
All sufficient grace for even me ,for
even me,
Broader than the scope of my
transgressions,
Greater far than all my sin and
shame,..
O magnify the precious name of
Jesus, Praise His name!

Verse 2
Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching to all the lost,..
By it I have been pardoned,
Saved to the uttermost,..
Chains have been torn asunder,
Giving me liberty;..
For the wonderful grace of
Jesus reaches me.

Verse 3
Wonderful grace of Jesus,
Reaching the most defiled,..
By its transforming power,
Making me God's dear child,
Purchasing peace and heaven,
For all eternity;..
And the wonderful grace of
Jesus reaches me.
