Song 114 - Will your anchor hold

Verse 1
Will your anchor hold in the
storms of life,
When the clouds unfold their wings
of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the
cables strain,
Will your anchor drift, or firm
remain?

Chorus 1
We have an anchor that keeps
the soul !
Steadfast and sure while
the billows roll,
Fastened to ' the Rock which
cannot move,
Grounded firm and deep in the
Saviour's love !

Verse 2
It is safely moored, 'twill
the storm withstand,
For 'tis well secured by the
Saviour's hand;
Though the tempest rage and the
wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our
bark o'erflow.

Verse 3
Will your anchor hold in
the straits of fear?
When the breakers roar and
the reef is near;
While the surges rave and
the wild winds blow,
Shall the angry waves then
your bank o'er flow?

Verse 4
Will your anchor hold in
the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill
your latest breath?
On the rising tide you can
never fail,
While your anchor holds
within the veil.

Verse 5
Will our eyes behold through
the morning light,
The city of gold, our harbour bright,
We shall anchor safe by
the heavenly shore,
When life's storms are past
forever more
