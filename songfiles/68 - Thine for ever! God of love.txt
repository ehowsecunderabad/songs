Song 68 - Thine for ever! God of love

Verse 1
Thine for ever! God of love,
Hear us from Thy throne above;
Thine for ever may we be,
Here and in eternity.

Verse 2
Thine for ever! Lord of life,
Shield us through our earthly strife;
Thou the Life, the Truth, the Way,
Guide us to the realms of day.

Verse 3
Thine for ever! O how blest
They who find in Thee their rest!
Saviour, Guardian, Heavenly Friend,
O defend us to the end!

Verse 4
Thine for ever! Shepherd keep
These Thy frail and trembling sheep;
Safe alone beneath Thy care,
Let us all Thy goodness share.

Verse 5
Thine for ever! Thou our Guide,
All our wants by Thee supplied,
All our sins by Thee forgiven,
Lead us, Lord, from earth to heaven.
