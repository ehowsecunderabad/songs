Song 240 - Glory, glory Lord

Glory, glory Lord
We give you glory Lord,
Glory, glory Lord
You are the mighty God

Verse 1
You who go down to the sea
You who live in the islands,
If you live in the city,
Lift your voice and sing out

Verse 2
Sing to the Lord a new song,
Sing His praise to the ends of
the earth,
Let every nation tell it,
Till every man has heard

You are the living God
You are the only God
You are the mighty God.
