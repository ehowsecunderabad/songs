Song 208 - I gave my life for thee

I gave my life for thee,
My precious blood I shed,
That thou might'st ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead:
I gave, I gave My life for thee;
What hast thou given for Me?

Verse 2
My Father's home of light,
My rainbow-circled throne,
I left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone:
I left, I left it all for thee;
Hast thou left aught for Me?

Verse 3
I suffered much for thee,
More than thy tongue can tell
Of bitter agony
To rescue thee from hell:
I've borne, I've borne it all for thee
What hast thou borne for Me?

Verse 4
And I have brought to thee,
Down from My home above,
Salvation full and free,
My pardon and My love;
I bring, I bring rich gifts to thee,
What hast thou brought to Me?

Verse 5
Lord let my life be given,
And every moment spent,
For God, for souls, for heaven,
And all earth's ties be rent,
Thou gav'st, Thou gav'st Thyself for me,
Now I give all for Thee.
