Song 307 - In His time, in His time

In His time, in His time
He makes all things beautiful,
In His time
Lord, please show me every day
As you're teaching me Your way
That You do just what You say '
In Your time.
In your time, in Your time
You make all things beautiful
In Your time
Lord, my life to You I bring,
May each song I have to sing
Be to You a lovely thing in Your time.
