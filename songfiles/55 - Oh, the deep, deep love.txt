Song 55 - Oh, the deep, deep love

Verse 1
Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Vast unmeasured, boundless, free;
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fullness over me.
Underneath me, all around me,
Is the current of Thy Love;
Leading onward, leading homeward,
To my glorious rest above.

Verse 2
Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Spread his praise from shore to shore;
How He loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore;
How He watcheth o'er His loved ones,
Died to call them all His own;
How for them He intercedeth.
Watcheth o'er them from the throne.

Verse 3
Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus!
Love of every love the best;
'Tis an ocean vast of blessing.
'Tis a heaven sweet of rest.
Oh, the deep, deep love of Jesus!
'Tis a heaven of heavens to me;
And it lifts me up to glory,
For it lifts me up to Thee.
