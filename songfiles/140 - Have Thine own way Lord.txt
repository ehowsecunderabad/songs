Song 140 - Have Thine own way Lord

Have Thine own way Lord
Have thine own way
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay
Mould me and make me after
Thy will
While I am waiting yielded and still

Verse 2
Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Search me and try me, Master, today!
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me
just now,
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.

Verse 3
Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!
Power all power, surely is Thine!
Touch me and heal me, Saviour
divine!

Verse 4
Have Thine own way, Lord!
Have Thine own way!
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!
Fill with Thy Spirit till all shall see,
Christ only, always, living in me!
