Song 196 - Search me, O God!

Search me, O God! my actions try,
And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all-searching eye-
To mine my ways make clear.

Verse 2
Search all my sense, and know my heart,
Who only canst make known,
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown

Verse 3
Throw light into the darkened cells
Where passions reign within;
Quicken my conscience till it fells
The loathsomeness of sin.

Verse 4
Search all my thoughts, the secret
springs,
The motives that control;
The chambers where polluted things
Hold empire o`er the soul.

Verse 5
Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
Its holy light through all,
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.

Verse 6
Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,
What now I feebly prove,
That God alone in Christ can be
Unutterable love!
