Song 350 - Come into his presence with

Come into his presence with
thanksgiving in your heart,
And give Him praise,
and give Him praise;
Come into His presence with
thanksgiving in your heart,
Your voices raise,
your voices raise.
Give glory and honor,
and power unto Him,
Jesus, the name above all names.
