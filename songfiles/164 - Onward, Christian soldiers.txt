Song 164 - Onward, Christian soldiers

Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the Cross of Jesus
Going on before:
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!

Chorus 1
Onward, Christian soldiers,
Marching as to war,
With the Cross of Jesus
Going on before:

Verse 2
At the Name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices:
Loud your anthems raise.

Verse 3
Like a mighty army,
Moves the Church of God:
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one body we.
One in hope and doctrine,
One in charity.

Verse 4
Crowns and thrones may perish
Kingdoms rise and wane,
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain;
Gates of hell can never
'gainst that Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
And that cannot fail.

Verse 5
Onward, then, ye people,
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph-song;
Glory, laud, and honour,
Unto Christ the King;
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.
