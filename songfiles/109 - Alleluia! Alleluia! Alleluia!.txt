Alleluia! Alleluia! Alleluia!
Verse 1
The strife is o'er, the battle done;
The victory of life is won;
The song of triumph has begun,
Alleluia!

Verse 2
The powers of death have
done their worst,
But Christ their legions
hath dispersed;
Let shouts of holy joy outburst,
Alleluia!

Verse 3
The three sad days have
quickly sped:
He rises glorious from the dead;
All glory to our risen Head!
Alleluia!

Verse 4
He brakes the bonds of
death and hell;
The bars from heaven's
high portals fell;
Let hymns of praise His
triumph tell. Alleluia!

Verse 5
Lord, by the stripes which wounded
Thee,
From death's dread sting Thy
servants free,
That we may live, and sing to Thee
Alleluia!
