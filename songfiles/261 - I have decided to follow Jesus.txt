Song 261 - I have decided to follow Jesus

I have decided to follow Jesus, (3)
No turning back, no turning back!
The cross before me, The world behind
me ''.(3)
No turning back, no turning back!
Though none go with me, still I will
follow '.. (3)
No turning back, no turning back!
The cross I'll carry 'til I see Jesus. (3)
No turning back, no turning back!
Will you decide now, to follow Jesus (3)
No turning back, no turning back!
Take the whole world, but give me
Jesus '. (3)
No turning back, no turning back!
