Song 427 - You laid aside Your majesty

You laid aside Your majesty,
Gave up everything for me,
Suffered at the hands,
Of those You have created;
You took all my guilt and shame,
When You died and rose again,
Now today You reign,
In Heaven and earth exalted
I really want to worship You my
Lord,
You have won my heart and now
I'm Yours,
Forever and ever, I will love You;
You are the Only One who died for
me,
Gave Your life to set me free,
So I lift my voice to You in adoration.
