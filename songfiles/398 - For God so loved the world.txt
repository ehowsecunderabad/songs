Song 398 - For God so loved the world

For God so loved the world
That He gave His Son,
If we in Him believe,
Eternal life we shall receive.
He gave sight to the blind,
And enlightened simple minds;
He made the deaf to hear,
And the frightened, not to fear.
He died upon the cross,
That we all may reign supreme,
Beyond every human dream.
He rose on the third morn,
That we all would be reborn;
He lives with us today,
And He walks our every way.
