Song 73 - Guard the Bible well

Verse 1
Guard the Bible well, all its foes repel
The sweet story tell of the Lord;
Guard what God revealed,
as our sun and shield;
Never, never yield His holy word.

Chorus 1
Rise, then Christians! Rally for the
Bible!
Work on, pray on, spread the truth
abroad;
Stand, then like men, in the cause
triumphant,
For the Bible is the Word of God.

Verse 2
Book of love divine,
precious Word of Thine,
Let it ever shine all abroad;
In the Spirit's might
We might win the fight
For this Gospel light,
The truth of God.

Verse 3
Shout the Bible song,
swell the mighty throng!
In the cause be strong for the right;
Look to God in prayer
when the foe you dare,
And for ever wear
His armour bright.

Verse 4
O ye Christian band,
for this Bible stand!
By the Lord's command,
Ne'er give o'er;
Lead the army on,
till the strife is done,
And the cause is won for evermore.
