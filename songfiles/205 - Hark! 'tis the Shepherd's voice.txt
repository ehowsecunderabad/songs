Song 205 - Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice

Hark! 'tis the Shepherd's voice I hear,
Out in the desert dark and drear,
Calling the sheep who've gone astray,
Far from the Shepherd's fold away.

Chorus 1
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring them in from the fields of sin:
Bring them in, bring them in,
Bring the wand'ring ones to Jesus.

Verse 2
Who'll go and help this Shepherd kind,
Help Him the wand'ring ones to find
Who'll bring the lost ones to the fold,
Where they'll be sheltered from the
cold?

Verse 3
Out in the desert hear their cry,
Out on the mountains wild and high;
Hark! 'tis the Master speaks to thee,
'Go, find my sheep where'er they be.
