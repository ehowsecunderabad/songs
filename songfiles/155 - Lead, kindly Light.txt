Song 155 - Lead, kindly Light

Lead, kindly Light,
amid the encircling gloom,
Lead Thou me on:
The night is dark,
And I am far from home;
Lead Thou me on.
Keep Thou my feet;
I do not ask to see
The distant scene;
one step enough for me.

Verse 2
I was not ever thus,
Nor prayed that Thou
Should'st lead me on;
I loved to choose
And see my path; but now
Lead Thou me on.
I loved the garish day,
And, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will:
Remember not past years.

Verse 3
So long Thy power hath blest me,
sure it still
Will lead me on
O'er moor and fen,
O'er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone;
And with the morn those
Angel-faces smile,
Which I have loved long since
And lost awhile.
