Song 8 - Children of Jerusalem

Verse 1
Children of Jerusalem,
Sang the praise of Jesus' Name
Children too of later days,
Join to sing the Saviour's praise,

Chorus 1
Hark! Hark! Hark!
While youthful voices sing
Hark! Hark! Hark!
While youthful voices sing
Loud hosannas, Loud hosannas,
Loud hosannas to our King.

Verse 2
We are taught to love the Lord;
We are taught to read His Word;
We are taught the way to heaven;
Praise for all to God be given.

Verse 3
Parents, teachers, old and young,
All unite to sing the song;
Higher and yet higher rise,
Till hosannas reach the skies.
