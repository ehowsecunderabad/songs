Song 355 - Faithful One, so unchanging

Faithful One, so unchanging,
Ageless One, You're my Rock of Peace
Lord of all, I depend on You;
I call out to You, again and again,
I call out to You, again and again.
You are my Rock in times of trouble,
You lift me up, when I fall down,
All through the storm, Your love is,
The anchor, my hope is in You, alone.
