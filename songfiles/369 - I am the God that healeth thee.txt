Song 369 - I am the God that healeth thee

I am the God that healeth thee,
I am the Lord, your Healer,
I sent My word and healed your
disease,
I am the Lord, your Healer.
You are the God that healeth me,
You are the Lord, my Healer,
You sent Your word and healed my
disease,
You are the Lord my Healer.
