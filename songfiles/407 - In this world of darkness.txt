Song 407 - In this world of darkness

In this world of darkness, We are
giving light
Hope for all the nations, How will they
know (2)
That Jesus loved them and He died to
save them
Carry the light, Carry the light
Carry the light, go and tell the children
They are precious in His sight
Carry the light, Carry the light
Carry the light, Go and preach the
gospel
For there is no more night, In the name
of Jesus Christ
Carry the light, Go and preach the
gospel
For there is no more night, In the name
of Jesus Christ
148
Carry the light
Count them by the million
Blind and slaves to sin
Inside they are dying
How will they know, how will they
know
That Jesus loves them and His heart is
broken.
