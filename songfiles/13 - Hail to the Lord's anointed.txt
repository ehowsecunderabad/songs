Song 13 - Hail to the Lord's anointed

Verse 1
Hail to the Lord's anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.

Verse 2
He comes with succor speedy
To those who suffer wrong;
To help the poor and needy,
And bid the weak be strong;
To give them songs for singing,
Their darkness turn to light,
Whose souls, condemned and dying,
Are precious in His sight.

Verse 3
He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth,
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth;
Before Him, on the mountains,
Shall peace, the herald, go,
And righteousness in fountains
From hill to valley flow.

Verse 4
Kings shall fall down before Him
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing.
For He shall have dominion
O'er river, sea, and shore:
Far as the eagle's pinion
Or dove's light wing can soar.

Verse 5
O'er every foe victorious
He on His throne shall rest
From age to age more glorious
All blessing and all blest
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove
His Name shall stand for ever
That Name to us is Love.
