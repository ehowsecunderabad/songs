Song 187 - Lord, dismiss us

Lord, dismiss us with Thy blessing,
Fill our hearts with joy and peace;
Let us each, Thy love possessing,
Triumph in redeeming grace;
Oh. refresh us! Oh. refresh us
Travelling through this wilderness.

Verse 2
Thanks we give and adoration,
For Thy Gospel's joyful sound;
May the fruits of Thy salvation,
In our hearts and lives abound.
May Thy presence, May Thy
presence,
With us evermore be found!

Verse 3
So, when'er the signal's given,
Us from earth to call away,
Borne on angel's wings to heaven,
Glad the summons to obey,
May we ever, May we ever,
Reign with Christ in endless day!
