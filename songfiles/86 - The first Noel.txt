Song 86 - The first Noel

Verse 1
The first Noel,
The angel did say,
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay;
In fields where they
Lay keeping their sheep,
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep.

Chorus 1
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel.

Verse 2
They looked up and saw a star,
Shining in the east beyond them far,
And to the earth it gave great light,
And so it continued both day and
Night

Verse 3
And by the light of that same star,
Three wise men came from country
far;
To seek for a king was their intent,
And to follow the star wherever it
Went

Verse 4
This star drew nigh to the north west,
O'er Bethlehem it took its rest,
And there it did both stop and stay,
Right over the place where Jesus lay

Verse 5
Then entered in those wise men three,
Full reverently upon the knee,
And offered there, in His presence,
Their gold, and myrrh,
and frankincense.
