Song 255 - God forgave my sin in Jesus

God forgave my sin in Jesus name,
I've been born again in Jesus name,
And in Jesus name I come to you,
To share His love as he told me to
He said, 'Freely, freely you have
received, Freely, freely give,
Go in my name and because you
believe
Others will know that I live.'
