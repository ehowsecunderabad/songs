Song 396 - May Your Spirit Lord

May Your Spirit Lord,
Guide me everywhere I go;
Make me a channel
Through which Your blessing flow
May I find You in the sick and in the
needy,
May I see You in the sad and in the
lonely;
May they feel Your ever healing
presence,
And find in You the strength they
need again,
May I bring Your compassions to the
abandoned,
To the unloved and neglected, Your
protection;
and may all those in sorrows and in
grief,
Find consolation in You and believe.
To those who find that life is such a
burden,
Give them courage and their little faith
to strengthen,
That Your people with one heart and
voice,
