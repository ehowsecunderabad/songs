Song 43 - There is a name I love to hear

Verse 1
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

Chorus 1
O how I love Jesus
O how I love Jesus
O how I love Jesus
Because He first loved me

Verse 2
It tells me of a Saviour's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.

Verse 3
It tells me what my Father hath
In store for ev'ry day,
And tho' I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

Verse 4
It tells of one whose loving heart,
can feel my deepest woe:
Who in each sorrow bears apart,
That none can bear below.
