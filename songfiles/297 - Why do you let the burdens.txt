Song 297 - Why do you let the burdens

Why do you let the burdens of tomorrow
Bring sorrow to your heart and trouble
too
For if the Father's eye is on the sparrow
Then surely He will care for you.
He knoweth, He careth
Each burden, He beareth
For if the Father's eye is on the sparrow
Then surely He will care for you.
