Song 78 - Hark! The herald angels sing

Verse 1
Hark! The herald angels sing,
'Glory to the new born King;
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;
God and sinners reconciled.''
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With th' angelic hosts proclaim
'Christ is born in Bethlehem!''

Chorus 1
Hark! The herald angels sing,
'Glory to the new-born King!''

Verse 2
Christ, by highest heaven adored;
Christ, the everlasting Lord:
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
Hail the incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to dwell,
Jesus our Immanuel..

Verse 3
Hail the heaven-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Risen with healing in His wings;
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them second birth.
