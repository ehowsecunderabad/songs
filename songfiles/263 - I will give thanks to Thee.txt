Song 263 - I will give thanks to Thee

I will give thanks to Thee,
O Lord, among the people.
I will sing praises to Thee
Among the nations.
For Thy steadfast love is great,
Is great unto the heavens,
And Thy faithfulness, Thy faithfulness
To the clouds.
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
Let Thy glory be over all the earth;
Be exalted, O God, above the heavens,
Let thy glory be over all the earth.
Let Thy glory, let Thy glory,
Let Thy glory be over all the earth!
