Song 246 - Bind us together, Lord,

Bind us together, Lord,
bind us together
With chords that cannot be broken
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together, Lord
Bind us together with love.

There is only one God,
There is only one King
There is only one body
That is why we sing.

We are the family of God
We are His promise divine
We are His chosen desire
We are the glorious new wine.
