Song 195 - One who is all unfit to count

One who is all unfit to count
As scholar in thy school,
Thou of thy love hath named a friend-
O kindness wonderful!

Verse 2
So weak am I O gracious Lord
So all unworthy of Thee,
That e'en the dust upon Thy feet
Outweighs me utterly.

Verse 3
Thou dwelleth in unshadowed light,
All sin and shame above -
That Thou shouldst bear our
sin and shame,
How can I tell such love?

Verse 4
Ah, did not He the heavenly throne
A little thing esteem
And not unworthy for my sake
A mortal body deem?

Verse 5
When in His flesh they drove the
nails,
Did He not all endure?
What name is there to fit a life
So patient and so pure?

Verse 6
So, Love itself in human form
For love of me He came
I cannot look upon His face
For shame, for bitter shame.

Verse 7
If there is aught of worth in me,
It comes from Thee alone;
Then keep me safe for so, O Lord,
Thou keepest but Thine own.
