Song 160 - My Jesus, I love Thee

My Jesus, I love Thee,
I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the follies of sin
I resign;
My gracious Redeemer,
My Saviour art Thou.

Chorus 1
I f ever I loved Thee, my Jesus tis now,

Verse 2
I love Thee because
Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon
On Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing
The thorns on Thy brow.

Verse 3
I'll love Thee in life,
I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as
Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death' dew
Lies cold on my brow.

Verse 4
In mansions of glory and
Endless delight,
I'll ever adore Thee
In heaven so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown
On my brow.
