Song 423 - This is my desire to honor You

This is my desire to honor You
Lord with all my heart I worship You
All I have within me I give you praise
All that I adore is in You
Lord I give You my heart, I give You my
soul
I live for you alone
Every breath that I take, Every moment
I'm awake
Lord have Your way in me
