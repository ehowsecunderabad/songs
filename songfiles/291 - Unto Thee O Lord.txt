Song 291 - Unto Thee O Lord

Unto Thee O Lord, do I lift up my soul;
O my God, I trust, in Thee.
Let me not be ashamed
Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Remember not the sins of my youth
O my God, I trust, in Thee.
Let me not be ashamed
Let not mine enemies triumph over me.
Show me Thy ways,
Thy ways O Lord.
Teach me Thy ways,
Thy ways O Lord
O my God, I trust in Thee
Let me not be ashamed
Let not mine enemies triumph over
me.
