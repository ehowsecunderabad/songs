Song 271 - Know ye not, know ye not

Know ye not, know ye not,
You are the temple?
Know ye not, know ye not,
You are the temple
Know ye not, know ye not,
You are the temple
You are the temple of the Holy Ghost.
Filled with praise, filled with power,
filled with glory''.
You are the temple of the Holy Ghost
