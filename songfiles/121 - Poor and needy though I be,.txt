Song 121 - Poor and needy though I be,

Verse 1
Poor and needy though I be,
God Almighty cares for me;
Gives me clothing, shelter, food,
Gives me all I have of good.

Verse 2
He will hear me when I pray-
He is with me night and day;
When I sleep and when I wake-
For the Lord my Saviour's sake.

Verse 3
He who reigns above the sky,
Once because as poor as I;
He whose blood for me was shed,
Had not where to lay His head.

Verse 4
Though I labour here awhile,
He will bless me with His smile;
And when this short life is past,
I shall rest with Him at last.

Verse 5
Then to Him I'll tune my song,
Happy as the day is long;
This my joy for ever be-
God Almighty cares for me.
