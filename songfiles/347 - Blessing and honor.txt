Song 347 - Blessing and honor

Blessing and honor, glory and power,
Be unto the Ancient of days.
From every nation, all of creation,
Bow before the Ancient of Days.

Every tongue in heaven and earth,
Shall declare Your glory,
Every knee shall bow at Your throne,
In worship, You will be exalted O God,
And Your kingdom shall not pass
away,
O Ancient of Days, (repeat verse and
chorus)

Your kingdom shall reign over all the
earth,
Sing unto the Ancient of Days.
For none can compare to
Your matchless worth,
Sing unto the Ancient of days.
