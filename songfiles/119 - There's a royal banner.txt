Song 119 - There's a royal banner

Verse 1
There's a royal banner given for
display
To the soldier of the King;
As an ensign fair we lift it up today,
While as ransomed ones we sing.

Chorus 1
Marching on! Marching on!
For Christ count everything but loss..
And to crown Him King, toil and sing,
'Neath the banner of the cross!

Verse 2
Though the foe may rage and gather
as the flood,
Let the standard be displayed!
And beneath its folds, as soldiers of
the Lord,
For the truth be not dismayed!

Verse 3
Over land and sea, wherever man
may dwell,
Make the glorious tidings known;
Of the crimson banner now the story
tell
While the Lord shall claim His own!
