Song 321 - Take me past the outer courts

Take me past the outer courts,
Into the Holy place,
Past the brazen altar,
Lord I want to see Your face.
Pass me by the crowds of people,
And the priests who sing their praise,
Lord I hunger and thirst for Your
righteousness,
But it's only found in one place.
Take me into the Holy of Holies,
Take me in by the blood of the Lamb.
Take me into the Holy of Holies,
Take the coal, cleanse my lips, here I
am.
