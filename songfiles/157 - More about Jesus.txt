Song 157 - More about Jesus

More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

Chorus 1
More, more about Jesus,
More, more about Jesus;
More of His saving fullness see,
More of His love who died for me.

Verse 2
More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God, my Teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

Verse 3
More About Jesus in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

Verse 4
More about Jesus, on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of
Peace.
