Song 269 - Jehovah Jireh, my Provider

Jehovah Jireh, my Provider,
His grace is sufficient for me, for me,
for me.
Jehovah Jireh, my Provider His grace
is sufficient for me
My God shall supply all my need
According to His riches in glory
He gives His angels charge over me
Jehovah Jireh cares for me, for me, for
me.
Jehovah Jireh cares for me.
