Song 116 - Jerusalem the golden

Verse 1
Jerusalem the golden,
With milk and honey blest,
Beneath thy contemplation
Sink heart and voice oppressed:
I know not, O, I know not
What joys await us there;
What radiancy of glory,
What light beyond compare.

Verse 2
They stand, those halls of Zion,
All jubilant with song,
And bright with many an angel,
And all the martyr throng,
The Prince is ever in them;
The daylight is serene;
The pastures of the blessed
Are decked in glorious sheen.

Verse 3
There is the throne of David,
And there, from care released,
The shout of them that triumph,
The song of them that feast;
And they who, with their Leader,
Have conquered in the fight,
For ever and for ever
Are clad in robes of white.

Verse 4
O sweet and blessed country,
The home of God's elect!
O sweet and blessed country,
That eager hearts expect!
Jesus, in mercy bring us
To that dear land of rest,
Who art, with God the Father
And Spirit, ever blest.
