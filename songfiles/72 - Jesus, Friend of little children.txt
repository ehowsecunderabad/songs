Song 72 - Jesus, Friend of little children

Verse 1
Jesus, Friend of little children,
Be a Friend to me;
Take my hand and ever keep me
Close to Thee.

Verse 2
Show me what my love should cherish,
What too, it should shun;
Lest my feet for poison-flowers
Swift should run.

Verse 3
Teach me how to grow in goodness,
Daily as I grow;
Thou hast been a Child, and surely
Thou dost know.

Verse 4
Fill me with Thy gentle meekness,
Make my heart like Thine;
Like an altar-lamp then let me
Burn and shine.

Verse 5
Step by step, oh, lead me onward,
Upward into youth,
Wiser, stronger still becoming
In thy truth.

Verse 6
Never leave me, nor forsake me,
Ever be my Friend;
For I need Thee from life's dawning
To its end.
