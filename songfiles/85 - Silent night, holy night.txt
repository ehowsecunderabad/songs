Song 85 - Silent night, holy night

Verse 1
Silent night, holy night,
All is clam, all is bright;
Round your Virgin Mother and Child!
Holy Infant so tender and mild;
Sleep in heavenly peace,
Sleep in heavenly peace.

Verse 2
Silent night, holy night,
Darkness flies, all is light;
Shepherds hear the angels sing
'Alleluia! hail the King!
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born.'

Verse 3
Silent night, holy night,
Son of God, Love's pure light;
Radiant beams from Thy holy face,
With the dawn of redeeming grace;
Jesus Lord at thy birth
Jesus Lord at thy birth

Verse 4
Silent night, holy night,
Wondrous Star, lend thy light;
With the angels let us sing,
Alleluia to our King;
Christ the Saviour is born
Christ the Saviour is born.
