Song 131 - Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts

Verse 1
Come, Holy Ghost, our hearts inspire
Let us Thine influence prove;
Source of the old prophetic fire,
Fountain of life and love.

Verse 2
Come, Holy Ghost, for moved by Thee,
The prophets wrote and spoke;
Unlock the truth, Thyself the key,
Unseal the sacred Book.

Verse 3
Expand Thy wings, celestial Dove,
Brood o'er our nature's night;
On our disordered spirits move,
And let there now be light.

Verse 4
God, through Himself, we then shall know,
If Thou within us shine;
And sound with all Thy saints below,
The depths of love divine.
