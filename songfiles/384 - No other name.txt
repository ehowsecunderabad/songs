Song 384 - No other name

No other name but the name of Jesus
No other name but the name of the
Lord;
No other name but the name of Jesus,
143
Is worthy of glory, and worthy of
honor,
And worthy of power and all praise.
(repeat)
His name is exalted far above the earth,
His name is high above the heavens;
His name is exalted far above the earth,
Give glory and honor,
And praise unto His name.
