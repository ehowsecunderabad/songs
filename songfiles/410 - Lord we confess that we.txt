Song 410 - Lord we confess that we

Lord we confess that we have wandered
From Your purpose and plan
And willingly walked in the wrong
direction
We've disobeyed Your commands
Father forgive us, Spirit come lead us
Back to the way, back to the truth
Back to the foot of the cross
Show us the ancient paths
Lead us along eternal high ways
We want to walk in the foot steps of
Jesus
We want to enter Your rest
Lord it's your mercy and good intention
That constantly calls us to You
Your infinite patience and kind correction
Your covenant love coming through
You are our hope and our salvation
You promised joy You give us grace
And courage to carry the cross
We want to leave a clear set of footprints
For those who will follow behind
Signpost in our lives that point to Jesus
A pathway they'll easily find
We want to fill up the sufferings of Jesus
As we obey, our lives display
The glorious way of cross
