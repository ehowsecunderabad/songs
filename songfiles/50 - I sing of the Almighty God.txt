Song 50 - I sing of the Almighty God

Verse 1
I sing of the Almighty God,
That made the mountains rise,
That spread the flowing seas abroad,
And built the lofty skies.

Verse 2
I sing the wisdom that ordained
The sun to rule the day;
The moon shines full at His command,
And all the stars obey.

Verse 3
I sing the goodness of the Lord,
That filled the earth with food;
He formed the creatures with His word.
And then pronounced them good.

Verse 4
Lord, how Thy wonders are displayed
Where'er I turn mine eye,
If I survey the ground I tread,
Or gaze upon the sky;

Verse 5
There's not a plant or flower below
But makes Thy glories known,
And clouds arise and tempests blow
By order from Thy throne.

Verse 6
God's hand is my perpetual guard,
He guides me with His eye;
Why should I then forget the Lord,
Whose love is ever nigh?
