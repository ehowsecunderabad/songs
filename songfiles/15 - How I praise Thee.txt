Song 15 - How I praise Thee

Verse 1
How I praise Thee, precious Saviour,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast saved and cleansed
and filled me,
That I might Thy channel be.

Chorus 1
Channels only, blessed Master,
But with all Thy wondrous power
Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
Every day and every hour.

Verse 2
Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
A clean vessel in Thy hand;
With no power but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

Verse 3
Witnessing Thy power to save me,
Setting free from self and sin;
Thou who boughtest to possess me;
In Thy fullness, Lord, come in.

Verse 4
Jesus, fill now with Thy Spirit
Hearts that full surrender know;
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow.
