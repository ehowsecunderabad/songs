Song 30 - O, for a heart to praise my God

Verse 1
O, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free;
A heart that always feels Thy blood,
So freely shed for me.

Verse 2
A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My great Redeemer's throne;
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

Verse 3
A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean;
Which neither life nor death can part,
From Him that dwells within.

Verse 4
A heart in every thought renewed,
And filled with love divine;
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good;
A copy, Lord, of Thine!

Verse 5
Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart!
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new Name upon my heart,
Thy new, best Name of Love.
