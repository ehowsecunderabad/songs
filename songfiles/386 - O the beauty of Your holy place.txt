Song 386 - O the beauty of Your holy place

O the beauty of Your holy place,
Your presence I love to embrace,
As I sit and behold Your loveliness,
What a privilege to come and rest.
I love to love You, O Lord my God
(3)
When I come to seek Your face,
I find mercy and grace. (repeat)
Where else can I go You are my
source,
I come to You O marvelous Lord,
And I thank You for the blood that set
me free,
For the blood that rent the veil for me.
