Song 360 - Great is the Lord and most

Great is the Lord and most worthy of
praise,
The city of our God, the holy place,
The joy of the world earth.
Great is the Lord in, whom we have the
victory,
He aids us against the enemy, we bow
down on our knees.
And Lord, we want to lift Your name on
high,
And Lord, we want to thank You for the
works
You've done in our lives;
And Lord, we trust in Your unfailing
love,
For you alone are God eternal,
Throughout earth and heaven above.
