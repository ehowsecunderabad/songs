Song 28 - Now thank we all our God

Verse 1
Now thank we all our God,
With hearts, and minds, and voices,
Who wondrous things hath done,
In whom His world rejoices;
Who, from our mother's arms
Hath blessed us on our way
With countless gifts of love,
And still is ours today.

Verse 2
Oh, may this bounteous God
Through all our life be near us,
With ever-joyful hearts
And blessed peace to cheer us;
And keep us in His grace,
And guide us when perplexed,
And free us from all ills
In this world and the next.

Verse 3
All praise and thanks to God
The Father now be given,
The Son, and Him who reigns
With them in highest heaven
The one eternal God,
Whom heaven and earth adore:
For thus it was, is now,
And shall be evermore.
