Song 221 - There's a call comes ringing

There's a call comes ringing o'er
the restless wave,
'Send the light! Send the light!''
There are souls to rescue, there are
souls to save.
'Send the light! Send the light!''

Chorus 1
Send the light!
The blessed gospel light;
Let it shine from shore to shore!
Send the light!
The blessed gospel light;
Let it shine for evermore!

Verse 2
We have heard the Macedonian call
today,
' Send the light! Send the light!''
And a golden offering at the cross
we lay,
'Send the light! Send the light!''

Verse 3
Let us pray that grace may every
where abound;
' Send the light! Send the light!''
And a Christ ' like spirit every
where be found.
'Send the light! Send the light!''

Verse 4
Let us not grow weary in the work
of love,
' Send the light! Send the light!''
Let us gather jewels for a crown above
'Send the light! Send the light!''
