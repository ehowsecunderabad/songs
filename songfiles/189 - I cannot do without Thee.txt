Song 189 - I cannot do without Thee

I cannot do without Thee,
O Saviour of the lost,
Whose precious blood redeemed me
at such tremendous cost;
Thy righteousness, Thy pardon,
Thy precious blood must be My only
hope and comfort,
My glory and my plea.

Verse 2
I cannot do without Thee,
I cannot stand alone.
I have no strength or goodness,
No wisdom of my own;
But Thou, beloved Saviour,
Art all in all to me,
And perfect strength in weakness
Is theirs who lean on Thee.

Verse 3
I cannot do without Thee,
For, oh, the way is long!
And I am often weary,
And sigh replaces song.
How can I do without Thee?
I do not know the way;
Thou knowest, and Thou leadest,
and wilt not let me stray.

Verse 4
I cannot do without Thee,
O Jesus, Saviour dear;
E'en when my eyes are holden,
I know that Thou art near;
How dreary and how lonely
This changeful life would be
Without the sweet communion,
The secret rest with Thee!

Verse 5
I cannot do without Thee,
For years are fleeting fast,
And soon in solemn loneliness
The river must be passed;
But Thou wilt never leave me,
And though the waves roll high,
I know Thou wilt be near me,
and whisper, 'It is I.'
