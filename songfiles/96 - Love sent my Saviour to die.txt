Song 96 - Love sent my Saviour to die

Verse 1
Love sent my Saviour to die in my stead,
Why should He love me so?..
Meekly to Calvary's cross He was led,
Why should He love me?..

Chorus 1
Why should He love me so?
Why should He love me so?
Why should my Saviour to
Calvary go?
Why should He love me so?'

Verse 2
Nails pierced His hands and His feet
for my sin,
Why should He love me so?..
He suffered sore my salvation to win,
Why should He love me so?'

Verse 3
O how He agonized there in my place,
Why should He love me so?'
Nothing withholding my sin to efface,
Why should He love me so?'
