Song 204 - The voice that breathed o'er

The voice that breathed o'er Eden,
That earliest wedding ' day,
The primal marriage blessing,
It hath not passed away,

Verse 2
Still in the pure espousal
Of Christian man and maid
The Holy Three are with us,
The threefold grace is said,

Verse 3
For dower of blessed children,
For love and faith's sweet sake,
For high mysterious union
Which naught on earth may break.

Verse 4
Be present, heavenly Father,
To give away this bride,
As Eve Thou gav'st to Adam
Out of his own pierced side.

Verse 5
Be present, gracious Saviour,
To join their loving hands,
As Thou didst bind two natures
In Thine eternal bands.

Verse 6
Be present, Holy Spirit,
To bless them as they kneel,
As Thou for Christ the Bridegroom
The heavenly spouse dost seal.

Verse 7
O spread Thy pure wings o'er them!
Let no ill power find place,
When onward through life's journey
The hallowed path they trace.

Verse 8
To cast their crown before Thee,
In perfect sacrifice,
Till to the home of gladness
With Christ's own bride they rise.
