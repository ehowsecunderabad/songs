Song 197 - Walk in the light

Walk in the light, so shalt thou know
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow
Who reigns in light above.

Verse 2
Walk in the light, and thou shalt find
Thy heart made truly His
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
In whom no darkness is.

Verse 3
Walk in the light and sin abhorred
Shall not defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.

Verse 4
Walk in the light, and e`en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
Glory shall chase away its gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.

Verse 5
Walk in the light, and thou shalt know
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone,
In which is perfect day.

Verse 6
Walk in the light-thy path shall be
Peaceful, serene, and bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is Light.
