Song 20 - I will sing the wondrous story

Verse 1
I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.

Chorus 1
Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me;
Sing it with the saints in glory,
Gathered by the crystal sea.

Verse 2
I was lost: but Jesus found me '
Found the sheep that went astray;
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

Verse 3
I was bruised: but Jesus healed me '
Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and tears possessed me
But He freed me from them all.

Verse 4
Days of darkness still come o'er me;
Sorrow's paths I often tread:
But the Saviour still is with me,
By His hand I'm safely led.

Verse 5
He will keep me till the river
Rolls its waters at my feet:
Then He'll bear me safely over,
Where the loved ones I shall meet.
