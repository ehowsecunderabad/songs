Song 169 - Shine out your light you are His

Shine out your light you are His
Let all them see your good deeds
And know who our Father is
That He may be glorified

Chorus 1
Light of the world
Salt of the earth,
City that's set on a hill
Kindle your heart, take a new birth
You have a task to fulfil

Verse 2
You are the salt of the earth
Heavenly Savour O sweet
When that is lost what's your worth?
Good to be thrown under the feet
Verse 3
Town on a hill can't be hid
That's you my friend can't come
down
So must you stand world's amid
Living to shine to be His crown

Verse 4
Beam out your light candle small
You are set to shine from a stand
Brighten the house for us all
Burning your life at his command.
