Song 328 - You are exalted Lord

You are exalted Lord, above all else,
We place You in the highest place,
Above all else.
Right now where we stand.
And every where we go,
We place You at the highest place,
So the world will know.
You are a mighty warrior,
Dressed in the armour of light,
Crushing the deeds of darkness,
Lead us on in the fight.
Through the blood of Jesus,
Victorious we stand,
We place You in the highest place.
Above all else in this land.
