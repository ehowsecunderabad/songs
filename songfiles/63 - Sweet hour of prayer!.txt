Song 63 - Sweet hour of prayer!

Verse 1
Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
That calls me from a world of care,
And bids me at my Father's throne,
Make all my wants and wishes known;
In seasons of distress and grief,
My soul has often found relief,
And oft escaped the tempter's snare,
By thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Verse 2
Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
Thy wings shall my petition bear,
To Him whose truth and faithfulness,
Engage the waiting soul to bless;
And since He bids me seek His face,
Believe His word and trust His grace,
I, cast on Him my ev'ry care,
And wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer

Verse 3
Sweet hour of prayer!
Sweet hour of prayer!
May I thy consolation share,
Till, from mount Pisgah's lofty height
I view my home, and take my flight;
This robe of flesh I'll drop, and rise,
To seize the everlasting prize;
And shout, while passing thro' the air
Farewell, farewell, sweet hour of prayer
