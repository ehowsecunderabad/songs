Song 282 - Seek Ye first the kingdom of God

Seek Ye first the kingdom of God
And His righteousness.
And all these things
Shall be added unto you
Hallelu-Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelu_Hallelujah
Ask and it shall be given unto you
Seek and ye shall find,
Knock and it
Shall be opened unto you,
Hallelu-Hallelujah.
Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by every word
That proceeds from the mouth of God.
Hallelu-Hallelujah
