Song 127 - Be Thou my Vision

Verse 1
Be Thou my Vision,
O Lord of my heart;
Naught be all else to me,
save that Thou art
Thou my best thought,
by day or by night,
Waking or sleeping,
Thy presence my light.

Verse 2
Be Thou my Wisdom,
And Thou my true Word;
I ever with Thee and,
Thou with me, Lord;
Thou my great Father,
I Thy true son;
Thou in me dwelling,
and I with Thee one.

Verse 3
Be Thou my battle-shield,
sword for the fight,
Be Thou my dignity,
Thou my delight,
Thou my soul's shelter,
Thou my high tower;
Raise Thou me heavenward,
O Power of my power.

Verse 4
Riches I heed not,
nor man's empty praise,
Thou mine inheritance,
now and always;
Thou and Thou only,
first in my heart,
High King of heaven
my treasure Thou art

Verse 5
High King of heaven,
my victory won,
May I reach heavens joys,
O bright heaven's Sun!
Heart of my own heart,
what ever be fall
Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
