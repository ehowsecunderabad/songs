Song 385 - O, heaven is in my heart

O, heaven is in my heart, (2)
(Leader) The Kingdom of our God is
here,
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Leader)The presence of His
majesty,
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Leader)And in His presence joy
abounds,
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Leader) The light of holiness
surrounds,
(All) Heaven is in my heart
His precious life on me He spent
Heaven is in my heart.
To give me life without an end
Heaven is in my heart.
In Christ is all my confidence
Heaven is in my heart.
The hope of my inheritance
Heaven is in my heart.
(Women) We are a temple for His
throne.
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Women) and Christ is the foundation
stone.
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Women) He will return to take us
home.
(All) Heaven is in my heart.
(Women) The Spirit and the Bride say
'Come!'
(All) Heaven is in my heart,
everybody sing!
