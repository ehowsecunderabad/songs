Song 429 - You have longed for sweet peace

You have longed for sweet peace,
and for faith to increase,
And have earnestly, fervently
prayed;
But you cannot have rest, or be
perfectly blest,
Until all on the altar is laid.
Is your all on the altar of sacrifice
laid?
Your heart does the Spirit control?
You can only be blest,
and have peace and sweet rest,
As you yield Him your body and
soul.
Would you walk with the Lord,
in the light of His Word,
And have peace and contentment
alway?
You must do His sweet will, to be free
from all ill,
On the altar you all you must lay.
Oh, we never can know what the Lord
will bestow
Of the blessings for which we have
prayed,
Till our body and soul He doth fully
control,
And our all on the altar is laid.
Who can tell all the love He will send
from above,
How happy our hearts will be made,
Of the fellowship sweet we shall share
at His feet,
When our all on the altar is laid.
