Song 285 - There is a Redeemer

There is a Redeemer,
Jesus, God's own son!
Precious lamb of God, Messiah.
Holy one!
Thank you, Oh my Father,
For giving us your Son,
And leaving your Spirit,
Till the work on earth is done!
Jesus, my Redeemer,
name above all names,
Precious Lamb of God, Messiah
O for sinners slain.
When I stand in glory,
I will see His face,
And there I'll serve my King forever
In that Holy place.
