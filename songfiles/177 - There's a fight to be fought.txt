Song 177 - There's a fight to be fought

There's a fight to be fought,
And a race to be run,
There are dangers to meet by the way,
But the Lord is my light
And the Lord is my life,
And the Lord is my strength and stay.
On His word I depend,
He's my Saviour and Friend;
And He tells me to trust and obey;
For the Lord is my light
And the Lord is my life,
And the Lord is my strength and stay.

Verse 2
In His wonderful love,
He came down from above
To suffer and die on the tree;
Now He's reigning up there,
Where He's gone to prepare
A place in His kingdom for me.
Let us sing as we go,
For He loveth us so,
We can never be lost by the way;
For the Lord is our light
And the Lord is our life,
And the Lord is our strength and stay.

Verse 3
Then He'll bring us at length,
By His infinite strength,
To the land that is fairer than day;
For the Lord is my light
And the Lord is my life,
And the Lord is my strength and stay.
So we'll sing to His praise,
To the end of our days,
As we travel each dangerous way;
For the Lord is my light
And the Lord is my life,
And the Lord is my strength and stay.
