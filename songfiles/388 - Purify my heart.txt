Song 388 - Purify my heart

Purify my heart
Let me be as gold
And precious silver,
Purify my heart,
Let me be as gold, pure gold.
Refiner's fire,
My heart's one desire is to be holy,
Set apart for You, Lord;
I choose to be holy,
Set apart for You, my Master,
Ready to do Your will.
Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from within
And make me holy,
Purify my heart,
Cleanse me from my sin, deep within.
