Song 357 - Fear not, for I am with you,

Fear not, for I am with you,
Fear not, for I am with you,
Fear not, for I am with you,
Says the Lord.
I have redeemed you,
I've called you by name,
Child, you are mine
when you walk through the waters,
I'll be there,
and through the flame
You'll not (noway) be drowned,
You'll not (noway) be burned,
For I am with you.
