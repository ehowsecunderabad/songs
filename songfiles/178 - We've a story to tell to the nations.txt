Song 178 - We've a story to tell to the nations

We've a story to tell to the nations,
That shall turn their hearts to theright
A story of truth and mercy,
A story of peace and light,
A story of peace and light.

Chorus 1
For the darkness shall turn to
dawning,
And the dawning to noonday bright,
And Christ's great kingdom shall
come to earth,
The kingdom of Love and Light.

Verse 2
We've a song to be sung to the nations,
That shall lift their hearts to the Lord,
A song that shall conquer evil,
And shatter the spear and sword
And shatter the spear and sword.

Verse 3
W've message to give to the nations,
That the Lord who reigneth above,
Hath sent us His son to save us,
And show us that God is love,
And show us that God is love.

Verse 4
We've a Saviour to-show to the nations,
Who the path of sorrow hath trod,
That all of the world's great peoples,
Might come to the truth of God.
Might come to the truth of God.
