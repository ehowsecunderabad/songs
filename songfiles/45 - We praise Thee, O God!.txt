Song 45 - We praise Thee, O God!

Verse 1
We praise Thee, O God!
For the Son of Thy love,
For Jesus who died,
and is now gone above.

Chorus 1
Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
Hallelujah! Amen;
Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
revive us again.

Verse 2
We praise Thee, O God!
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Saviour,
and scattered our night.

Verse 3
All glory and praise
to the Lamb that was slain,
Who has borne all our sins,
and hath cleansed every stain.

Verse 4
Revive us again,
fill each heart with Thy love;
May each soul be rekindled
with fire from above.
