Song 417 - Over the mountains and the sea

Over the mountains and the sea
Your river runs with love for me
And I will open up my heart
And let the Healer set me free
I'm happy to be in the truth
And I will daily lift my hands
For I will always sing
Of when your love came down
I could sing of your love forever (4)
Oh I feel like dancing
It's foolishness I know
But when the world has seen the light
They will dance with joy like we're
dancing now
