Song 372 - In heavenly armour we'll

In heavenly armour we'll enter the
land,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
No weapon that's fashion'd against us
will stand,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
And we sing glory, honour,
Power and strength, to the Lord (2)
When the power of darkness comes in
like a flood,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
He'll raise up a standard, the power of
His blood,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
When your enemy presses in hard,
do not fear,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
Take courage my friend,
your redemption is near,
The battle belongs to the Lord.
