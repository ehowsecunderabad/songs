Song 363 - God is good all the time

God is good all the time
He put a song of praise
In this heart of mine,
God is good all the time,
Through the darkest night,
His Light will shine
God is good, God is good all the time.

If you're walking through the valleys
And there are shadows all around,
Do not fear, He will guide you,
He will keep you safe and sound,
He has promised to never leave you,
Nor forsake you and His word is true.

We were sinners so unworthy
Still for us He chose to die,
Filled us with His Holy Spirit,
Now we can stand and testify,
That His love is everlasting,
And His mercies they will never end.
