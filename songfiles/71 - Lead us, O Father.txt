Song 71 - Lead us, O Father

Verse 1
Lead us, O Father,
in the paths of peace;
Without Thy guiding hand
we go astray,
And doubts appal,
and sorrows still increase;
Lead us through Christ,
the true and living way.

Verse 2
Lead us, O Father,
in the paths of truth;
Unhelped by Thee,
in error's maze we grope,
While passion stains and
folly dims our youth,
And age comes on uncheered
by faith and hope.

Verse 3
Lead us, O Father,
in the paths of right;
Blindly we stumble
when we walk alone,
Involved in shadows of
a darksome night,
Only with Thee we journey
safely on.

Verse 4
Lead us, O Father,
to Thy heavenly rest,
However rough and
steep the path may be,
Through joy or sorrow,
as Thou deemest best,
Until our lives are perfected
in Thee. Amen.
