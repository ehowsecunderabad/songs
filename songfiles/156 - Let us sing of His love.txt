Song 156 - Let us sing of His love

Let us sing of His love once again '
Of the love that can never decay,
Of the blood of the Lamb who was slain
Till we praise Him again in that day.

Chorus 1
In the sweet ' 'by-and-by''
We shall meet on that beautiful shore;
In the sweet ' 'by-and-by''
We shall meet on that beautiful shore.

Verse 2
There is cleansing and healing for all
Who will wash in the life-giving flood,
There is life everlasting and joy.
At the right hand of God through the
blood.

Verse 3
Even now while we taste of His love,
We are filled with delight at His Name;
But what will it be when above
We shall join in the song of the Lamb?
