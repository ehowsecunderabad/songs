Song 209 - I hear Thy welcome voice

I hear Thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.

Chorus 1
I am coming Lord,
Coming now to Thee;
Wash me, cleanse me, in the blood
That flowed on Calvary.

Verse 2
'Tis Jesus calls me on
To perfect faith and love,
To perfect hope, and peace, and trust,
For earth and heaven above.

Verse 3
'Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
Where reigned the power of sin.
