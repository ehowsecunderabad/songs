Song 165 - Out in the highways and

Out in the highways and
byways of life,
Many are weary and sad;
Carry the sunshine where
darkness is rife,
Making the sorrowing glad.

Chorus 1
Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
Out of my life may Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing, O Saviour, I pray,
Make me a blessing to someone today.

Verse 2
Tell the sweet story of Christ
` and His Love,
Tell of His power to forgive;
Others will trust Him
if only you prove,
True, every moment you live.

Chorus 1
Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
Out of my life may Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing, O Saviour, I pray,
Make me a blessing to someone today.

Verse 3
Give as 'twas given to you
in your need,
Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed,
Unto your mission be true.

Chorus 1
Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
Out of my life may Jesus shine;
Make me a blessing, O Saviour, I pray,
Make me a blessing to someone today.
