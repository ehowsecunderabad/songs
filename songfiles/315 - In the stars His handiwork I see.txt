Song 315 - In the stars His handiwork I see

In the stars His handiwork I see,
On the wind He speaks with majesty.
Though He ruleth over land and sea,
What is that to me?
I will celebrate Nativity
For it has a place in history
Sure He came to set His people free
What is that to me?
Till by faith I met Him face to face,
And I felt the wonder of His grace
Then I knew that He was more,
Than just a God who didn't care,
Who lived away up there,
And now I walk beside Him day by
day,
Ever watching o'er me lest I stray,
Helping me to find the narrow way,
He's everything to me.
