Song 224 - Lost sinners are dying

Lost sinners are dying in darkness
today
And no one seems willing to show
them the way
Oh fill me with passion and vision
I pray
Make me a winner of souls.

Chorus 1
Make me a winner of souls,
Make me a winner of souls
Lead me I pray, to someone today,
Make me a winner of souls.

Verse 2
Oh give me a heart Lord with
Thy love aflame
A love that can stoop to the world's
Sin and shame
To rescue the dying,
Lost sinners reclaim
Make me a winner of souls.

Verse 3
The daylight is fading and
Soon it will be night
And still there's a harvest,
The great fields are white
Tis, now I must labour while
Yet there is light
Make me a winner of souls.

Verse 4
Someday I shall stand in that
Heavenly place
There, meet the Lord Jesus and
Talk face to face
Oh that I might carry some
Trophies of grace
Make me a winner of souls.
