Song 17 - I have found a friend in Jesus,

Verse 1
I have found a friend in Jesus,
He's ev'rything to me,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Lily of the Valley, in Him alone
I see,
All I need to cleanse and make me
fully whole.
In sorrow He's my comfort,
in trouble He's my stay,
He tells me ev'ry care on Him to roll.

Chorus 1
He's the Lily of the Valley,
the Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand
to my soul.

Verse 2
He all my griefs has taken,
and all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my strong
and mighty tow'r;
I have all for Him forsaken,
and all my idols torn,
From my heart, and now
He keeps me by His pow'r.
Though all the world forsake me, and
satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely
reach the goal.

Verse 3
He will never, never leave me,
nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith and
do His blessed will;
A wall of fire about me,
I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He my hungry
soul shall fill,
Then sweeping up to glory
to see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight
shall ever roll.
