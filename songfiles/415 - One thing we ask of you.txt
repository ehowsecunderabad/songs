Song 415 - One thing we ask of you

One thing we ask of you
One thing that we desire
That as we worship You
Lord come and change our lives
Arise, arise, arise, arise
Arise take your place be enthroned on
our praise
Arise King of Kings Holy God as we
sing Arise
We lift you up (2)
We lift you up on our praises
