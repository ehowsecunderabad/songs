Song 100 - What can wash away my sin

Verse 1
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

Chorus 1
Oh, precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Verse 2
For my cleansing this I see '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
For my pardon this my plea '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Verse 3
Nothing can for sin atone '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
Naught of good that I have done '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;

Verse 4
This is all my hope and peace '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
This is all my righteousness '
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
