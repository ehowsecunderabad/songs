Song 92 - Long time ago in Bethlehem

Verse 1
Long time ago in Bethlehem,
So the Holy Bible says;
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ,
Was born on Christmas day.

Chorus 1
Hark now hear the angels sing,
New King's born today
And man will live for evermore
Because of Christmas day
Trumpets sound and angels sing,
Listen to what they say
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
was born on Christmas day

Verse 2
While shepherds watch their,
flocks by night,
They see a bright new star
They hear a choir sing a song
Music seemed to come from afar.

Verse 3
While Joseph and his wife Mary,
Came to Bethlehem that night,
They found no place to lay the Child,
Not a single room was in sight.

Verse 4
And then they found a little nook,
In a stable all forlorn,
And in a manger cold and dark,
Mary's little Boy was born
