Song 53 - All things bright and beautiful

Chorus 1
All things bright and beautiful,
All creatures great and small,
All things wise and wonderful,
The Lord God made them all

Verse 1
Each little flower that opens,
Each little bird that sings,
He made their glowing colours,
He made their tiny wings.

Verse 2
The purple-headed mountain,
The river running by,
The sunset, and the morning,
That brightens up the sky.

Verse 3
The cold wind in the winter,
The pleasant summer sun,
The ripe fruits in the garden,
He made them everyone.

Verse 4
He gave us eyes to see them,
And lips that we might tell,
How great is God Almighty,
Who hath done all things well.
