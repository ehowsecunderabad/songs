Song 404 - I know He rescued my soul

I know He rescued my soul
His blood has covered my sin
I believe I believe
My shame He has taken away
My pain is healed in His name
I believe I believe
I'll raise a banner oh
'cause my Lord has conquered the grave
My Redeemer lives (x4)
You lift my burden
I'll raise with You
I'm dancing on this
Mountain top
To see Your Kingdom come
My Redeemer lives ....
