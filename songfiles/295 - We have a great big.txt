Song 295 - We have a great big

We have a great big wonderful God (2)
A God who loves every one of us,
Done so much for all of us,
A great big wonderful God.
He will never never leave us,
He's always standing by.
He'll pick us up when we stumble
We are the apple of His eye
We have a great big wonderful God (2)
AGod who loves every one of us,
Does so much for all of us
A great big wonderful God
A great' big' wonderful'. God
