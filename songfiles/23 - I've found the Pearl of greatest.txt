Song 23 - I've found the Pearl of greatest

Verse 1
I've found the Pearl of greatest price,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, a Christ I have;
Oh, what a Christ have I.

Verse 2
Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
A Prophet full of light;
A Priest that stands 'twixt God and man
A King that rules with might.

Verse 3
My Christ, He is the Lord of lords,
He is the King of kings;
He is the Sun of Righteousness,
With healing in His wings.

Verse 4
My Christ, He is the Tree of Life,
Who in God's garden grows,
Whose fruit doth feed, whose leaves
doth heal;
My Christ is Sharon's Rose.

Verse 5
Christ is my meat, Christ is my drink,
My medicine my health;
My peace, my strength, my joy,
my crown,
My glory and my wealth.

Verse 6
Christ is my Father, and my Friend,
My Brother, and my Love;
My Head, my Hope, my Counsellor,
My Advocate above.

Verse 7
My Christ, He is the Heaven of
heavens;
My Christ what shall I call?
My Christ is First, my Christ is Last,
My Christ is All in all.
