Song 277 - O come let us adore Him

O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
O come let us adore Him
Christ, The Lord!
For he alone is worthy,
For he alone is worthy,
For he alone is worthy,
Christ, the Lord!
We'll give Him all the glory,
We'll give Him all the glory,
We'll give Him all the glory,
Christ, the Lord.
He's the Lily of the valley,
He's the Lily of the valley,
He's the Lily of the valley,
Christ, the Lord!
