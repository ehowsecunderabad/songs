Song 245 - All over the world,

All over the world,
The Spirit is moving,
All over the world,
As the prophet said it would be,
All over the world,
There's mighty revelation
Of the glory of the Lord,
As the waters cover the sea.
Deep down in my heart,
The Spirit is moving,
Deep down in my heart,
As the prophet said it would be.
Deep down in my heart,
There's a mighty revelation
Of the glory of the Lord,
As the waters cover the sea.
