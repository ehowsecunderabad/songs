Song 413 - We believe in God the Father

We believe in God the Father
Maker of the universe
And in Christ His Son our Saviour
Come to us by virgin birth
We believe He died to save us
Bore our sins, was crucified
Then from death He rose victorious
Ascended to the Father's side

Jesus, Lord of all, Lord of all (4)
Name above all names (3)

We believe He sends His Spirit,
On His Church with gifts of pow'r
God His Word of truth affirming
Sends us to the nations now.
He will come again in glory
Judge the living and the dead
Every knee shall bow before Him
Then must every tongue confess.
