Song 242 - Ah, Lord God,

Ah, Lord God,
Thou hast made the Heavens and the
Earth
By Thy great power
Ah, Lord God,
Thou has made the Heavens and the
Earth
By Thine outstretched hand!
Nothing is too difficult for Thee!
Nothing is too difficult for Thee!
Great and Mighty God,
Great in counsel and mighty in deed,
Nothing, nothing, absolutely nothing,
Nothing is too difficult for thee!
