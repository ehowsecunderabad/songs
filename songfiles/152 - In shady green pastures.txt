Song 152 - In shady green pastures

In shady green pastures,
so rich and so sweet,
God leads His dear children along;
Where the water's cold flow bathes
the weary one's feet,
God leads His dear children along.

Chorus 1
Some through the waters, 
Some through the flood,
Some through the fire, 
but all through the blood,
Some through great trials, 
but God gives a song
In the night season 
and all the day long

Verse 2
Sometimes in the mount where
the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest
of night.
God leads His dear children along.

Verse 3
Though sorrows befall us,
and Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer,
defeat all our foes.
God leads His dear children along.
