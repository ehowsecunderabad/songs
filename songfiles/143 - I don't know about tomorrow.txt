Song 143 - I don't know about tomorrow

I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day
I don't borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to grey
I don't worry o'er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

Chorus 1
Many things about tomorrow, I don't
seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow and I
know who holds my hand.

Verse 2
Ev'ry step is getting brighter,
As the golden stairs I climb.
Ev'ry burden getting lighter,
Ev'ry cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eye.
83
At the ending of the rainbow,
where the mountains touch the sky.

Verse 3
I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty,
But the one who feeds the sparrow,
Is the one who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood.
