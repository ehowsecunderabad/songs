Song 405 - I lay my life down at Your feet

I lay my life down at Your feet
You're the only one I need
Turned to You and You were always
there
Trouble times its You I seek
Put You first its all I need
Humble all I am all to You
One way Jesus
You're the only one that
I could live for
You are always, always there
Even here and everywhere
Grace abounds so deeply within me
You'll never every change
Yesterday today the same
Forever till forever meets no end
You are the way the truth and the life
I live by faith and not by sight for You
I'm livin all for You.
