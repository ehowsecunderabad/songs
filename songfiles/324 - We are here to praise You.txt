Song 324 - We are here to praise You

We are here to praise You,
To lift our hearts and sing.
We are here to give You,
The best that we can bring.
And it is our love,
Rising from our hearts,
Everything within us cries 'Abba
Father',
Help us now to give You,
Pleasure and delight,
Hearts and minds and will that say:
'I love You Lord'.
