Song 47 - Ever and always be praise

Verse 1
Ever and always be praise,
Eternal Lord to Thee-ever
and always be praise.
Boundless with mercy
Thy arms are encircling us, (repeat)
Ceaseless with praise with
our songs we'll encompass Thee.
Ever and always be praise.

Verse 2
Healing He brings in his train,
He knows our weaknesses-healing
He brings in His train.
Sins are forgiven and
our souls are revived again, (repeat)
Sonship restored and
their salvation brought to men.
Ever and always be praise.

Verse 3
As east is far from the west,
So far our transgressionsas
east is far from the west,
Have been removed, and
His mercy made manifest, (repeat)
Judgment delivered for all
them that are oppressed.
Ever and always be praise.

Verse 4
Life like the grass will decay,
Like flowers will pass away-life like
the grass will decay,
But will not wither where held by His
faithfulness, (repeat)
Faith clingeth fast to
His unwearied changelessness.
Ever and always be praise.

Verse 5
Throned in the heavens, He is Lord,
Through ages changelessly-throned in
the heavens He is Lord.
Blessed through all
generations eternally, (repeat)
Bless Him my soul,
in thy Savior rejoicing thee
Ever and always be praise.
