Song 182 - Why should I feel discouraged

Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come
Why should my heart be lonely
And long for heaven and home
When Jesus is my portion
My faithful friend is He
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.

Chorus 1
I'll sing because I am happy
I'll sing because I am free
For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

Verse 2
Let not your heart be troubled
His tender word I hear
And resting on his goodness
I loose my doubts and fears
Though by the path He leadeth
But one step I may see
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.

Verse 3
Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise
When songs give place to sighs
When hope within me dies
I draw much closer to Him
From care He sets me free
His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me.
