Song 183 - Blest be the tie that binds

Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love:
The fellowship of kindred minds
Is like to that above.

Verse 2
Before our Father's throne
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are
one,
Our comfort and our cares.

Verse 3
We share our mutual woes,
Our mutual burdens bear,
And often for each other flows
The sympathizing tear.
