Song 249 - Come bless the Lord,

Come bless the Lord,
all ye servants of the Lord,
Who stand by night, In the house of the
Lord,
Lift up your hands, in the Holy place,
And bless the Lord, And bless the Lord.
O taste and see, that the Lord is good (3)
Blessed is the man, who trusts in Him.
He lifted me up, from the miry clay
And set my feet, on a rock to stay
He put a song, in my heart to stay
A song of praise, a song of praise.
