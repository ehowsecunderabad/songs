Song 286 - There's a fight to be fought

There's a fight to be fought,
And a race to be run,
There are dangers to meet by the way;
But the Lord is my light, and the Lord is
my life,
And the Lord is my strength and stay.
On His Word I depend, He's my
Saviour and Friend
And He tells me to trust and obey;
For the Lord is my light, and the Lord is
my life
And the Lord is my strength and stay.
