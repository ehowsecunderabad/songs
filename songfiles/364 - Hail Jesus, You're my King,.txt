Song 364 - Hail Jesus, You're my King,

Hail Jesus, You're my King,
Your life frees me to sing;
I will praise you all my days,
You're perfect in all your ways.
Hail Jesus, You're my Lord
I will obey Your word;
I want to see your kingdom come,
Not my will, but Yours be done.
Glory, glory to the Lamb,
You'll take me into the land;
We will conquer in Your name,
We will proclaim that Jesus reigns.
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah,
How powerful You are;
Hail, hail, Lion of Judah,
How wonderful You are.
