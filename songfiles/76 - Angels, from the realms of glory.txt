Song 76 - Angels, from the realms of glory

Verse 1
Angels, from the realms of glory,
Wing your flight o'er all the earth;
Ye who sang creation's story,
Now proclaim Messiah's birth:
Come and worship!
Christ the new born King
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Verse 2
Shepherds, in the fields abiding,
Watching o'er their flocks by night;
God with man is now residing,
Yonder shines the Infant light:
Come and worship!
Christ the new born King
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Verse 3
Sages, leave your contemplations;
Brighter visions beam afar!
Seek the great 'Desire of nations,''
Ye have seen His Natal star:
Come and worship!
Christ the new born King
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!

Verse 4
Saints before the altar bending,
Watching long in hope and fear,
Suddenly the Lord, descending,
In His temple shall appear:
Come and worship!
Christ the new born King
Come and worship!
Worship Christ, the new-born King!
