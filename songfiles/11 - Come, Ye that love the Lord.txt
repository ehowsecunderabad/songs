Song 11 - Come, Ye that love the Lord

Verse 1
Come, Ye that love the Lord,
And let your joys be known,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
Join in a song with sweet accord,
And thus surround the throne.
And thus surround the throne.

Chorus 1
We're marching to Zion,
Beautiful, beautiful Zion;
We're marching upward to Zion,
The beautiful city of God.

Verse 2
Let those refuse to sing
Who never knew our God;
But children of the heavenly King
But children of the heavenly King
Must speak their joys abroad.
Must speak their joys abroad.

Verse 3
The hill of Zion yields
A thousand sacred sweets,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Before we reach the heavenly fields,
Or walk the golden streets.
Or walk the golden streets.

Verse 4
The men of grace have found;
Glory begun below,
Celestial fruit on earthly ground,
Celestial fruit on earthly ground,
From faith and hope may grow
From faith and hope may grow.

Verse 5
Then let our songs abound,
And every tear be dry;
We're marching through
Immanuel's ground,
We're marching through
Immanuel's ground,
To fairer worlds on high.
To fairer worlds on high.
