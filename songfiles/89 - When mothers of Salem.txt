Song 89 - When mothers of Salem

Verse 1
When mothers of Salem,
Their children brought to Jesus,
The stern disciples drove them back,
And bade them depart:
But Jesus saw them ere they fled,
And sweetly smiled and kindly said
'Suffer little children to come unto Me.'

Verse 2
'For I will receive them,
And hold them in My bosom;
I'll be a Shepherd to those lambs,
Oh, drive them not away!
For if their hearts to Me they give,
They shall with Me in glory live:
'Suffer little children to come unto Me.'

Verse 3
How kind was our Saviour
To bid those children welcome!
But there are many thousands who
Have never heard His Name;
The Bible they have never read;
They know not that the Saviour said,
'Suffer little children to come unto Me.'

Verse 4
Oh, soon may the heathen,
Of every tribe and nation
Fulfill Thy blessed Word
And cast their idols all away,
Oh shine upon them from above,
And show Thyself a God of love;
Teach them, dear Saviour, to come
unto Thee.
