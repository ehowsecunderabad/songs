Song 150 - All to Jesus I surrender

All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

Chorus 1
I surrender all, I surrender all,
All to Thee, my blessed Saviour,
I Surrender all.

Verse 2
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Wordly pleasures all forsaken,
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

Verse 3
All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Saviour, wholly Thine
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

Verse 4
All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessings fall on me.
