Song 175 - There is a place of quiet rest

There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where sin cannot molest
Near to the heart of God.

Chorus 1
O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
Sent from the heart of God,
Hold us, who wait before Thee,
Near to the heart of God.

Verse 2
There is a place of comfort sweet,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where we our Saviour meet,
Near to the heart of God.

Verse 3
There is a place of full release,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where all is joy and peace,
Near to the heart of God.
