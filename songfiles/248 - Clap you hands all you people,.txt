Song 248 - Clap you hands all you people,

Clap your hands all you people,
Shout unto God with a voice of
triumph!
Clap your hands all you people
Shout unto God with a voice of praise!
Hosanna! Hosanna!
Shout unto God with a voice of
triumph!
Praise Him! Praise Him!
Shout unto God with a voice of
praise!
