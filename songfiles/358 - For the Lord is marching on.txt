Song 358 - For the Lord is marching on

For the Lord is marching on,
And His army is ever strong,
And His glory shall be seen upon our
land.
Raise the anthem, sing the victor's
song,
Praise the Lord for the battle's won;
No weapon formed against us shall
stand!
For the Captain of the host is Jesus,
We're following in His footsteps;
No foe can stand against us in the fray.
We are marching in Messiah's band,
The key of victory is His mighty hand;
Let us march on to take our promised
land!
For the Lord is marching on,
And His army is very strong,
And His glory shall be seen upon our
land.
