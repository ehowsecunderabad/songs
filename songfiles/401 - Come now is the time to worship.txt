Song 401 - Come now is the time to worship

Come now is the time to worship
Come, now is the time to give your heart
Come, just as you are to worship
Come, just as you are before your God, come
One day every tongue will confess You are God
One day every knee will bow
But still the greatest treasure remains for those
Who gladly choose You now
