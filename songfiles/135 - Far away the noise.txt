Song 135 - Far away the noise

Far away the noise of strife upon my
ear is falling,
Then I know the sins of earth beset on
ev'ry hand;
Doubt and fear and things of earth in
vain to me are calling,
None of these shall move me from
Beulah land.

Chorus 1
I'm living on the mountain, under
neath a cloudless sky,
I'm drinking at the fountain that
never shall run dry;
O yes! I'm feasting on the manna from a
bountiful supply,
For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

Verse 2
Far below the storm of doubt upon
the world is beating,
Sons of men in battle long the enemy
withstand;
Safe am I within the castle of God's
word retreating,
Nothing then can reach me ' 'tis
Beulah Land.

Verse 3
Let the stormy breezes blow, their
cry cannot alarm me;
I am safely sheltered here, protected
by God's hand;
Here the sun is always shining, here
there's naught can harm me,
I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

Verse 4
Viewing here the works of God,
I sink in contemplation,
Hearing now His blessed voice,
I see the way He planned:
Dwelling in the Spirit, here I learn of
full salvation,
Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.
