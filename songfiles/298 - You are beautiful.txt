Song 298 - You are beautiful

You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words,
Too wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard
Who can grasp your infinite wisdom
Who can fathom the depths of your
love
You are beautiful beyond description
Majesty enthroned above.
And I stand, I stand, in awe of you!
I stand, I stand, in awe of you!
Holy God to whom all praise is due,
I stand in awe of you!
