Song 117 - On, Thee my heart is resting!

Verse 1
On, Thee my heart is resting!
Ah, this is rest indeed!
What else, Almighty Saviour,
Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
Thy love is all my stay;
Our Father's home in glory
Draws nearer every day.

Verse 2
My guilt is great, but greater
The mercy Thou dost give;
Thyself, a spotless Offering,
Has died that I should live.
With Thee my soul unfettered
Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
Thy Word is all my trust.

Verse 3
Through me, Thou gentle Master,
Thy purposes fulfil!
I yield myself for ever
To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness?
My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
Has all things, having Thee.
