Song 215 - Rescue the perishing,

Rescue the perishing,
care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from
sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one,
lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus,
the Mighty to save.

Chorus 1
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

Verse 2
Though they are slighting Him,
still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive:
Plead with them earnestly,
plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

Verse 3
Down in the human heart,
crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that
grace can restore;
Touched by a loving hand,
wakened by kindness,
Chords that were broken will
vibrate once more.

Verse 4
Rescue the perishing,
duty demands it;
Strength for thy labour
the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way
patiently win them;
Tell the poor wanderers a
Saviour has died.
