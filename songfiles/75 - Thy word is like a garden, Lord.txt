Song 75 - Thy word is like a garden, Lord

Verse 1
Thy word is like a garden, Lord,
With flowers bright and fair,
And every one who seeks may pluck
A lovely nosegay there.

Verse 2
Thy word is like a deep, deep mine,
And jewels rich and rare
And hidden in its mighty depths
For every searcher there.

Verse 3
Thy Word is like the starry host;
A thousand rays of light
Are seen to guide the traveller,
And make his pathway bright.

Verse 4
Thy word is like a glorious choir,
And loud its anthems ring;
Though many tongues and parts unite;
It is one song they sing.

Verse 5
Thy word is like an armoury,
Where soldiers may repair,
And find for life`s long battleday
All needful weapons there.

Verse 6
Oh! may I love Thy precious word,
May I explore its mine!
May I its fragrant flowers glean,
May light upon me shine!

Verse 7
Oh! may I find my armour there
Thy word my trusty sword;
I`ll learn to fight with every foe
The battle of the Lord.
