Song 287 - Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy

Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Thou art worthy, O Lord,
To receive glory, glory and honor,
Glory and honor and power
For Thou hast created;
And all things created
Thou hast created all things!
And for Thy pleasure they are created,
Thou art worthy, O Lord
He is worthy (2)
Worthy the Lamb to receive
Power and riches
Wisdom and honour
Glory and power and might
For He has been slain,
Redeemed men to God
From every nation and tribe
And made us a Kingdom
Priests unto God
Worthy is the Lamb
