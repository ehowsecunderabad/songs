Song 412 - You are filled with compassion

You are filled with compassion and
mercy and grace
With Your banner of Love over me
I am longing to see you one day face
to face
And to be with You endlessly
Lord, how lovely You are to me
Lovely Lord, You are all to me
Lovely Lord, Full of purity
Worthy of honour and majesty
Lord, how lovely You are to me
You are bright as the sunrise and
fairest of all
Unto You all the glory will b e
You are God of creation and Lord of
my life
I will worship You faithfully
Lord, how lovely You are to me
