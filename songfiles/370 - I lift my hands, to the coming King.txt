Song 370 - I lift my hands, to the coming King

I lift my hands, to the coming King,
To the great 'I AM', to You I sing.
For You're the one, who reigns within
my heart.
And I will serve no foreign god,
nor any other treasure;
You are my heart's desire,
The Spirit without measure,
Unto Your name, I will bring, my
sacrifice.
