Song 192 - God make my life a little light

God make my life a little light
Within the world to glow;
A little flame that burneth bright,
Wherever I may go.

Verse 2
God make my life a little flower
That giveth joy to all,
Content to bloom in native bower,
Although the place be small.

Verse 3
God make my life a little song
That comforteth the sad;
That helpeth others to be strong,
And makes the singer glad.

Verse 4
God make my life a little staff
Whereon the weak may rest,
That so what health and strengthI have,
May serve my neighbours best.

Verse 5
God make my life a little hymn
Of tenderness and praise;
Of faith - that never waxeth dim,
In all His wondrous ways.
