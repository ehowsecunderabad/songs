Song 139 - Guide me, O Thou great

Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty;
Hold me with Thy powerful hand:
Bread of heaven, Bread of heaven,
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more,
Feed me till I want no more.

Verse 2
Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through:
Strong Deliverer, Strong Deliverer,
Strong Deliverer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield,
Be Thou still my strength and
shield.

Verse 3
When I tread the verge of Jordan,
Bid my anxious fears subside;
Death of death and Hell's destruction
Land me safe on Canaan's side:
Songs of praises, Songs of praises
I will ever give to Thee,
I will ever give to Thee.
