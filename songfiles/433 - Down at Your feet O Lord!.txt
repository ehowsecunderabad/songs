Song 433 - Down at Your feet O Lord!

Down at your feet, O Lord, is the
most high place
In Your presence, LordI seek Your
face (2)
There is no higher calling, no
greater honour,
Than to bow and kneel before Your
throne.
I'm amazed at Your glory, embraced
by Your mercy,
O Lord! I live to worship You!
