Song 91 - Would you like to hear the story

Verse 1
Would you like to hear the story
Of someone who loves you
Who had promised to be with you
Everywhere you go.

Chorus 1
His name is Jesus,
His name is Savior,
Who wants you to follow,
Will you follow Him?

Verse 2
Would you like to hear the story
Of one who gives you
His flesh and blood
On the Holy Cross

Verse 3
Would you like to hear the story
Of someone who receives you
By cleansing your sins away,
When you hear His call.

Verse 4
Would you like to hear the story
Of someone who is waiting
To receive you in His glory
When He comes again!
