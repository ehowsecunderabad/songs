Song 391 - There's a feeling in the air

There's a feeling in the air
That God is everywhere,
And his resurrection power,
Is moving at this hour,
That Jesus might be glorified.
I will glorify the name of the Lord,
I will glorify His name,
And his resurrection power,
Is moving in this hour, That Jesus
might be glorified.
