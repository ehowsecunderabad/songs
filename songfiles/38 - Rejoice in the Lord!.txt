Song 38 - Rejoice in the Lord!

Verse 1
Rejoice in the Lord!
O, let His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall:
Redeemed by His blood,
why should we ever fear '
Since Jesus is our 'all in all'?

Chorus 1
'If God be for us, if God be for us,
if God be for us
Who can be against us?
Who?'.. Who?'' Who?''
Who can be against us, against us?''

Verse 2
Be strong in the Lord!
Rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the
right,
And He will be our strength and stay.

Verse 3
Confide in His Word '
His promises so sure;
In Christ they are 'yea and amen;''
Though earth pass away,
they ever shall endure,
'Tis written o'er and o'er again.
