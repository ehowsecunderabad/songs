Song 179 - When peace, like a river

When peace, like a river,
Attendeth my way;
When sorrows, like sea-billows, roll;
Whatever my lot,
Thou hast taught me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Chorus 1
It is well, ' with my soul '
It is well, it is well with my soul.

Verse 2
Though Satan should buffet,
Though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded
My helpless estate,
And hath shed His own
Blood for my soul.

Verse 3
My sin ' oh, the bliss of
This glorious thought!
My sin ' not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His cross,
And I bear it no more:
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
O my soul!

Verse 4
For me be it Christ,
Be it Christ hence to live!
If Jordan above me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine,
For in death as in life,
Thou wilt whisper
Thy peace to my soul.

Verse 5
And, Lord, haste the day
When the faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll,
The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend,
'Even so'' ' it is well with my soul.
