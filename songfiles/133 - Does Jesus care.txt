Song 133 - Does Jesus care

Verse 1
Does Jesus care when my heart is pained,
Too deeply for mirth and song;
As the burdens press, and the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

Chorus 1
O Yes, He cares; I know He cares,
His heart is touched with my grief;
When the days are weary, the long nights dreary,
I know my Saviour cares.

Verse 2
Does Jesus care when my way is dark,
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?

Verse 3
Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed,
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief I find no relief,
Tho' my tears flow all the night long?

Verse 4
Does Jesus care when I've said 'good-bye'',
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches till it nearly breaks,
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?
