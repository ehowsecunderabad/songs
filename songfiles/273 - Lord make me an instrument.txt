Song 273 - Lord make me an instrument

Lord make me an instrument,
An instrument of worship,
I lift up my hands in Your name.
Lord make me an instrument,
An instrument of worship,
I lift up my hands in Your name.
I'll sing you a love song,
A love song of worship,
I'll lift up my hands in Your name,
I'll sing you a love song,
A love song of worship,
I'll lift up my hands in Your name.
For we are a symphony,
A symphony of worship,
We lift up our hands in Your name,
For we are a symphony,
A symphony of worship,
We lift up our hands in Your name.
We'll sing you a love song,
A love song of worship,
We'll lift up our hands in Your name,
We'll sing you a love song,
A love song to Jesus,
We lift up our hands in Your name.
