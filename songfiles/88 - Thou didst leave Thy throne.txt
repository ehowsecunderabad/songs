Song 88 - Thou didst leave Thy throne
Verse 1
Thou didst leave Thy throne
and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home was there
found no room,
For Thy holy nativity:

Chorus 1
Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 2
Heaven's arches rang, when the
angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal decree;
But of lowly birth, didst Thou come
to earth,
And in greatest humility:

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 3
The foxes found rest, and the birds
their nest,
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod,
O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee:

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 4
Thou camest, O Lord, with the
living Word,
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn, and with
crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary:

Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus
There is room in my heart for Thee.

Verse 5
When heaven's arches ring,
And her choirs shall sing,
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me home, saying,
'Yes there is room,
There is room at My side for thee:''

My heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus
When Thou comest and callest for me.
