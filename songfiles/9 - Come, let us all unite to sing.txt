Song 9 - Come, let us all unite to sing

Verse 1
Come, let us all unite to sing '
God is love! God is love!
While heaven and earth
their praises bring-
God is love! God is love!
Let every soul from sin awake,
Each in his heart sweet music make,
And sweetly sing for Jesus' sake-
God is love! God is love!

Verse 2
Oh, tell to earth's remotest bound-
God is love! God is love!
In Christ is full redemption found-
God is love! God is love!
His blood can cleanse our sins away;
His Spirit turns our night to day,
And leads our souls with joy to say-
God is love! God is love!

Verse 3
How happy is our portion here-
God is love! God is love!
His promises our spirits cheer-
God is love! God is love!
He is our Sun and Shield by day,
By night He near our tents will stay,
He will be with us all the way-
God is love! God is love!

Verse 4
What though my heart and
flesh shall fail-
God is love! God is love!
Through Christ I shall o'er
death prevail-
God is love! God is love!
E'en Jordan's swell I will not fear,
For Jesus will be with me there,
My soul above the waves to bear '
God is love! God is love!

Verse 5
In Zion we shall sing again-
God is love! God is love!
Yes, this shall be our highest strain-
God is love! God is love!
Wilst endless ages roll along,
In concert with the heavenly throng,
This shall be still our sweetest song
God is love! God is love!
