Song 24 - Jesus shall reign

Verse 1
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His kingdom stretch from shore to
shore
Till moon shall wax and wane no
more

Verse 2
To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And endless praises crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall rise,
With every morning sacrifice.

Verse 3
People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest
song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His Name

Verse 4
Blessings abound where'er He reigns
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains
The weary find eternal rest
And all the sons of want are blest.

Verse 5
Let every creature rise and bring,
His grateful honors to our King,
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen!
