Song 99 - There is a fountain filled

Verse 1
There is a fountain filled with blood,
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains;

Verse 2
The dying thief rejoiced to see,
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away;

Verse 3
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood,
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed Church of God,
Be saved, to sin no more;

Verse 4
E'er since, by faith, I saw the stream,
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die;

Verse 5
Then in a nobler sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save,
When this poor lisping,
Stammering tongue,
Lies silent in the grave;
