Song 304 - Holy holy, holy holy

Holy holy, holy holy
Holy holy, Lord God Almighty
And ' we lift our hearts before You
As a token of our love.
Holy holy, holy holy.
Gracious Father, Gracious Father
We're so blest to be Your children
Gracious Father
And we lift our hearts before You
As a token of our love
Gracious Father, gracious Father
Precious Jesus, precious Jesus
We're so glad that You've redeemed
us
Precious Jesus,
And we lift our hands before You
As a token of our love
Precious Jesus, precious Jesus
Holy, Spirit, Holy Spirit
Come and fill our hearts a new
Oh Holy Spirit
And we lift our voice before You
As a token of our love
Holy Spirit, Holy Spirit
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
And we lift our hearts before You
As a token of our love,
Hallelujah, Hallelujah.
