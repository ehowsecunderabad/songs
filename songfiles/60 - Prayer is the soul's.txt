Song 60 - Prayer is the soul's

Verse 1
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
Uttered or unexpressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.

Verse 2
Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear;
The upward glancing of an eye
When none but God is near.

Verse 3
Prayer is the simplest from of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer, the sublimest strains that reach,
The Majesty on high.

Verse 4
Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice,
Returning from his ways;
While angels in their songs rejoice,
And cry, 'Behold, He prays!''

Verse 5
Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
The Christian's native air,
His watchword at the gate of death;
He enters heaven with prayer.

Verse 6
O Thou, by whom we come to God
The Life, the Truth, the Way;
The path of prayer Thyself hath trod;
Lord, teach us how to pray!
