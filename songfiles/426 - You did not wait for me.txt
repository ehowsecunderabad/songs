Song 426 - You did not wait for me

You did not wait for me,
To draw near to You,
But You clothed Yourself, with frail
humanity,
You did not wait for me, to cry out to
You,
But You let me hear Your voice calling
me
And I'm forever grateful to You,
I'm for ever grateful for the cross,
I'm forever grateful to You,
That You came to seek and save the
lost.
