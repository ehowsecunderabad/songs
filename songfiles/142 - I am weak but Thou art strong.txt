Song 142 - I am weak but Thou art strong

I am weak but Thou art strong
Jesus keep me from all wrong,
I'll be satisfied as long,
As I walk, let me walk close to thee.

Chorus 1
Just a closer walk with Thee
Grant it Jesus this my plea;
Daily walking close with Thee
Let it be, dear Lord, let it be.

Verse 2
Thru this world of toils and snares,
If I falter, Lord who cares?
Who with me my burden shares?
None but Thee, dear Lord,
None but Thee.

Verse 3
When my feeble life is o'er
Time for me will be no more;
Guide me gently safely o'er
To Thy kingdom shore,
To Thy shore.
