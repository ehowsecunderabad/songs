Song 258 - He is my everything, He is my all

He is my everything, He is my all;
He is my everything both great
and small;
He gave His life for me,
made everything new,
He is my everything, now how about
you?
Like honey in the rock,
Sweet honey in the rock
For He tastes like honey in the rock,
O taste and see that the Lord is good,
For He tastes like honey in the rock.
