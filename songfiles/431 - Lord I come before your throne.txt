Song 431 - Lord I come before your throne

Lord I come before your throne of grace,
I find rest in Your presence,
and fullness of joy
In worship and wonder I behold Your face
Singing what a faithful God have I

What a faithful God have I,
what a faithful God
What a faithful God have I,
You're faithful every way

Lord of mercy You have heard my cry
Through the storm You're the beacon
My song in the night,
In the shelter of Your wings
Hear my heart's reply,
singing what a faithful God have I

Lord, all sovereign granting
peace from heaven
Let me comfort those who suffer
With the comfort You have given
I will tell of Your great love
for as long as I live
Singing what a faithful God Have
