Song 111 - Thine be the glory

Verse 1
Thine be the glory,
risen conquering Son,
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won;
Angels in bright raiment
rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes,
where Thy body lay.

Chorus 1
Thine be the glory,
risen, conquering Son,
Endless is the victory
Thou o'er death hast won.

Verse 2
Lo! Jesus meets us,
risen from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us,
scatters fear and gloom;
Let the Church with gladness,
hymns of triumph sing,
For the Lord now liveth,
death hath lost its sting.

Verse 3
No more we doubt Thee,
glorious Prince of life;
Life is naught without Thee:
aid us in our strife;
Make us more than conquerors,
through Thy deathless love:
Bring us safe through Jordan
to Thy home above.
