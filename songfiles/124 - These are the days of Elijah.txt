Song 124 - These are the days of Elijah

These are the days of Elijah,
Declaring the word of the Lord.
And these are the days of Your servant Moses,
Righteousness being restored.
And though these are days of great trial,
Of famine and darkness and sword.
Still we are the voice in the desert crying
Prepare ye the way of the Lord.

Chorus 1
Behold He comes riding on the clouds,
Shining like the sun at the trumpet call,
Lift your voice, it's the year of jubilee
Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes. (x2)

Verse 3
These are the days of Ezekiel,
The dry bones becoming as flesh.
And these are the days of Your servant David
Rebuilding the temple of praise.
And these are the days of the harvest,
The fields are as white in the world
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard
Declaring the word of the Lord.
(Repeat Chorus)
There is no God like Jehovah (x8)
