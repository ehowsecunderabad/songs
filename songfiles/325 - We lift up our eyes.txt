Song 325 - We lift up our eyes

We lift up our eyes,
Above the trouble,
In our land, and together we stand,
To declare you as king.
In times like these,
We choose to praise You,
For it's You, it's You who really matters,
You are worthy of all praise.
And we will say that You are good,
All the miracles You've done have
brought us joy,
For we are changed,
And all the hope we have we place in
You right now,
Father we declare that we love You,
We declare our everlasting love for You.
