Song 81 - Never shone a light so fair

Verse 1
Never shone a light so fair,
Never fell so sweet a song,
As the chorus in the air
Chanted by the angel-throng,
Every star took up the story.

Chorus 1
Christ has come, the prince of glory,
Come in humble hearts to dwell;
God with us, God with us,
God with us, Immanuel !

Verse 2
Still that jubilee of song
Breaks upon the rising morn;
While the anthem rolls along,
Floods of light the earth adorn;
Old and young take up the story.

Verse 3
Welcome now the blessed day,
When we praise the Lord our king;
When we meet to praise and pray,
And His love with gladness sing;
Let the world take up the story
