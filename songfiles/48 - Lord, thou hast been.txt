Song 48 - Lord, thou hast been

Verse 1
Lord, thou hast been our dwelling
place
In generations all.
Before thou ever hadst brought forth
The mountains great and small.

Verse 2
Before thou e'er hadst formed the
earth,
And all the world abroad,
Thou e'en from everlasting art
The everlasting God.

Verse 3
And now thou to destruction dost
Man that is mortal turn,
And unto them thou sayest, Return
Again, you sons of men.

Verse 4
Because a thousand years appear
No more before Thy sight
Than yesterday when it is past,
Or than a watch by night.

Verse 5
At morn it flourishes and grows,
Cut down at eve, it's dried.
For by Thine anger we're consumed,
Thy wrath makes us afraid.

Verse 6
So teach thou us to number well
Our days, e'en so that we
Our inner man to wisdom's ways
May earnestly apply.
