Song 320 - Salvation belongs to our God

Salvation belongs to our God,
Who sits upon the throne,
And unto the Lamb.
Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
Honor and power and strength.
Be to our God, forever and ever, (3)
Amen!
And we the redeemed shall be strong,
In purpose and unity,
Declaring aloud,
Praise and glory, wisdom and thanks,
Honor and power and strength.
