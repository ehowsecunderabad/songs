Song 14 - Holy, Holy, Holy

Verse 1
Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord God Almighty!
Early in the morning
our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy,
Merciful and Mighty,
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity.

Verse 2
Holy, Holy, Holy,
All the saints adore Thee,
Casting down their golden crowns
around the glassy sea;
Cherubim and Seraphim
falling down before Thee,
Who wert, and art, and
evermore shalt be.

Verse 3
Holy, Holy, Holy,
Though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man
Thy glory may not see;
Only Thou art holy,
there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power,
in love, and purity.

Verse 4
Holy, Holy, Holy,
Lord God Almighty!
All Thy works shall praise Thy
Name, in earth, and sky, and sea;
Holy, Holy, Holy,
Merciful and Mighty,
God in Three Persons,
blessed Trinity!
