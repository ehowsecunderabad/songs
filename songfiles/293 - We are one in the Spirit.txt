Song 293 - We are one in the Spirit

We are one in the Spirit,
We are one in the Lord,
And we look for the day when your
spirit is out poured:

CHO:
And they'll know we are Christians
by our love, by our love
Yes, they'll know we are Christians by
our love.

We will walk with each other
We will walk hand in hand.
And together we'll spread the news that
God is in our land
All praise to the Father from whom all
things come,
And praise to Christ Jesus, His only
Son,
And all praise to the Spirit, who makes
us one:
