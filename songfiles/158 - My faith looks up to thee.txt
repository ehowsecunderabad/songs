Song 158 - My faith looks up to thee

My faith looks up to thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Saviour Divine!
Now hear me while I pray,
Take all my guilt away,
O, let me from this day
Be wholly Thine!

Verse 2
May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As thou hast died for me,
O, may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire!

Verse 3
While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

Verse 4
When ends life's transient dream,
When death's cold, sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll;
Blest Saviour, then in love
Fear and distrust remove;
Oh, bear me safe above,
A ransomed soul.
