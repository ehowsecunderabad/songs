Song 367 - He walked where I walk

He walked where I walk, (echo)
He stood where I stand, (echo)
He felt what I feel, (echo)
He understands. (echo)
He knows my frailty,
(echo)
Shared my humanity, (echo)
Tempted in everyway, (echo)
Yet without sin. (echo)
God with us so close to us
God with us Immanuel.
One of our hated race, (echo)
Stung by the prejudice, (echo)
Suffering injustice, (echo)
Yet He forgives.
Wept for my wasted years, (echo)
Paid for my wickedness, (echo)
He died in my place, (echo)
That I might live. (echo)
