Song 146 - I need Thee every hour

I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

Chorus 1
I need Thee, O, I need Thee!
Every hour I need Thee:
O, bless me now, my Saviour,
I come to Thee.

Verse 2
I need Thee every hour:
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

Verse 3
I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.
