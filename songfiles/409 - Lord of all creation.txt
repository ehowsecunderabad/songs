Song 409 - Lord of all creation

Lord of all creation
Of water, earth and sky,
The heavens are Your tabernacle,
Glory to the Lord on high.
God of wonders beyond our galaxy,
You are holy, holy
The universe declares Your majesty.
Lord of heaven and earth
Early in the morning,
I will celebrate the light.
When I stumble in the darkness,
I will call Your Name by light
Halleluiah
To the lord of heaven and earth
