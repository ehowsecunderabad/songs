Song 44 - To God be the glory!

Verse 1
To God be the glory!
Great things He hath done!
So loved He the world
that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life
an atonement for sin.
And opened the life-gate
that all may go in.

Chorus 1
Praise the Lord! Praise the lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!
Oh, come to the Father,
through Jesus the Son;
And give Him the glory!
Great things He hath done!

Verse 2
O, perfect redemption,
the purchase of blood;
To every believer
the promise of God;
The vilest offender
who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus
a pardon receives.

Verse 3
Great things He hath taught us,
great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing
through Jesus the Son:
But purer and higher
and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport,
when Jesus we see!
