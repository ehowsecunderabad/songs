Song 193 - Jesus, stand among us

Jesus, stand among us,
In Thy risen power;
Let this time of worship
Be a hallowed hour

Verse 2
Breathe Thy Holy Spirit,
Into every heart,
Bid the fears and sorrows
From each soul depart.

Verse 3
Thus with quickened footsteps
We'll pursue our way,
Watching for the dawning
Of eternal day
