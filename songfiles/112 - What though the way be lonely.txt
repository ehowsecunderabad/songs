Song 112 - What though the way be lonely

Verse 1
What though the way be lonely
And dark the shadows fall
I know wherever it leadeth
My Father planned it all.

Chorus 1
I'll sing thro the shade and
the sun shine.
I'll trust Him whatever be fall
I'll sing for I cannot be silent
My Father planned it all.

Verse 2
There may be sunshine tomorrow
Shadows may break and flee
It will be the way He chooses
My Father planned it all.

Verse 3
He guides my faltering footsteps
Along the weary way
For well He knows the pathway
He'll lead to endless days.

Verse 4
A day of light and gladness
On which no shade will fall
'Tis this at last awaits me
My Father planned it all.
