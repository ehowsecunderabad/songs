Song 98 - Precious, precious blood of Jesus

Verse 1
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Shed on Calvary;
Shed for rebels, shed for sinners,
Shed for thee!

Chorus 1
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Shed on Calvary:
Oh, believe it; oh, receive it,
'Tis for thee.

Verse 2
Precious, precious blood of Jesus,
Let it make thee whole;
Let it flow in mighty cleansing
O'er thy soul.

Verse 3
Though thy sins are red like crimson,
Deep in scarlet glow,
Jesus' precious blood shall wash thee
White as snow.

Verse 4
Precious blood that hath redeemed us!
All the price is paid!
Perfect pardon now is offered,
Peace is made.
