Song 303 - Who is like unto Thee

Who is like unto Thee
O Lord among gods?
Who is like unto Thee
Glorious in holiness
Fearful in praises
Doing wonders?
Who is like unto Thee?
No one is like unto Thee
O Lord among gods
No one is like unto Thee
Glorious in holiness
Fearful in praises
Doing wonders
No one is like unto Thee.
