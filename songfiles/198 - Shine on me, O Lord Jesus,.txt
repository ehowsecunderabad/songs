Song 198 - Shine on me, O Lord Jesus,

Shine on me, O Lord Jesus,
And let me ever know
The grace that shone from Calvary,
Where Thou didst love me so.
'My child, I am thy Saviour,
`Tis not what thou dost feel,
But Mine own gracious promise
Which does thy pardon seal. '

Verse 2
Shine in me, O Lord Jesus,
And let Thy searching light
Reveal each hidden purpose,
Each thought as in Thy sight,
'My child, I am thy Searcher,
I try each loving heart,
For I would have most holy,
All who in Me have part.'

Verse 3
Shine through me, then, Lord Jesus,
That all the world may see
The life I live is Thy life,
And thus be drawn to Thee.
'My child, I am thy Power;
With those who hear My voice
I ever dwell, and use them,
Thus making them rejoice.'

Verse 4
Shine out, shine out, Lord Jesus,
Thou light of all the world;
Oh, let Thy Gospel banner
Be everywhere unfurled!
'My child, hast thou forgotten
That name is also thine?
My fruit is borne on branches,
Not by the parent Vine.'

Verse 5
Arise and shine, Lord Jesus,
Thou Bright and Morning Star;
I long for Thine appearing,
When peace shall follow war.
'My child, before I gather
My family in one,
Its number needs completing;
T`wards this, what has thou done?'
