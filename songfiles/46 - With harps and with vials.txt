Song 46 - With harps and with vials

Verse 1
With harps and with vials
there stand a great throng
In the presence of Jesus,
and sing this new song:

Chorus 1
Unto Him who hath loved us
and washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory for ever!
Amen.

Verse 2
All these once were sinners,
defiled in His sight;
Now arrayed in pure garments
in praise they unite:

Verse 3
He maketh the rebel
a priest and a king;
He hath bought us, and taught us
this new song to sing:

Verse 4
How helpless and hopeless
we sinners had been
If He never had loved us,
Nor cleansed from our sin!

Verse 5
Aloud in His praises our
voices shall ring,
So that others, believing,
this new song shall sing:
