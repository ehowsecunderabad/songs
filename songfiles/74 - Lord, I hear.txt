Song 74 - Lord, I hear

Verse 1
Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
Thou art scatt'ring full and free,
Show'rs the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some dropping fall on me.

Chorus 1
Even me, even me,
Let thy blessing fall on me.

Verse 2
Pass me not, O tender Saviour!
Let me love and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favor;
Whilst Thou'rt calling, O call me.

Verse 3
Pass me not, O mighty Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see;
Witnesser of Jesus' merit,
Speak the word of pow'r to me.

Verse 4
Love of God, so pure and changeless;
Blood of Christ, so rich and free;
Grace of God, so strong and boundless;
magnify them all in me.

Verse 5
Pass me not! Thy lost one bringing,
Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
While the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, O bless me.
