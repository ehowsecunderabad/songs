Song 390 - The Lord reigns, The Lord reigns,

The Lord reigns, The Lord reigns,
The Lord reigns,
Let the earth rejoice (3)
Let the people be glad
That our God reigns.
A fire goes before Him
And burns up all His enemies
The hills melt like wax
At the presence of the Lord
At the presence of the Lord.
The heavens declare His righteousness
The people see His glory
For You alone are exalted
Over all the earth
Over all the earth.
