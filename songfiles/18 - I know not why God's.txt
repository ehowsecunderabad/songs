Song 18 - I know not why God's

Verse 1
I know not why God's
wondrous grace,
To me He hath made known,
Nor why unworthy ' Christ in love,
Redeemed me for His own.

Chorus 1
But 'I know whom I have believed,
And I am persuaded that He is able,
To keep that which I've committed,
Unto Him against that day.''

Verse 2
I know not how this saving faith,
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His Word,
Wrought peace within my heart.

Verse 3
I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convicting men of sin;
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

Verse 4
I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me '
Of weary ways or golden days
Before His face I see.
