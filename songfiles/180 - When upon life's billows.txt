Song 180 - When upon life's billows

When upon life's billows
You are tempest-tossed,
When you are discouraged,
Thinking all is lost;
Count your many blessings
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
What the Lord hath done.

Chorus 1
Count' your blessings,
Name them one by one,
Count' your blessings,
See what God hath done;
Count' your blessings,
Name them one by one,
And it will surprise you
what the Lord hath done.

Verse 2
Are you ever burdened
With a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear?
Count your many blessings,
Every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing
As the days go by.

Verse 3
When you look at others
With their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you
His wealth untold;
Count your many blessings;
Wealth can never buy
Your reward in heaven,
Nor your home on high.

Verse 4
So, amid the conflict,
Whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged,
God is over all;
Count your many blessings,
Angels will attend,
Help and comfort give You
To your journey's end.
