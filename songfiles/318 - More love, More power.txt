Song 318 - More love, More power

More love, More power, more of
You in my life, (2)
And I will worship You, with all of
my heart,
I will worship You, with all of my
mind,
I will worship You, with all of my
strength,
For You are my Lord, You are my
Lord.
And I will seek Your face, with all of
my heart,
And I will seek Your face, with all of
my mind,
And I will seek Your face, with all of
my strength,
For You are my Lord, You are my
Lord.
