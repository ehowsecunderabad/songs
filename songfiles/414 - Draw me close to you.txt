Song 414 - Draw me close to you

Draw me close to you, never let
me go
I lay it all down again
To hear you say that I am your
friend
You are my desire, No one else
would do
'Coz nothing else could change your
place
To feel the warmth of your embrace
Help me find the way, bring me
back to you
You are all I want, You are all I ever
needed
YOu are all I want, Help me know
You I need
