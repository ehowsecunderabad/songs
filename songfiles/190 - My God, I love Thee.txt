Song 190 - My God, I love Thee

My God, I love Thee - not because
I hope for heaven thereby,
Nor yet because who love Thee not
Are lost eternally.

Verse 2
Thou, O my Jesus, Thou didst me
Upon the Cross embrace;
For me didst bear the nails and spear,
And manifold disgrace.

Verse 3
And grief and torments numberless,
And sweat of agony,
And death itself-and all for me,
Who was Thine enemy.

Verse 4
Then why, O blessed Jesus Christ,
Should I not love Thee well?
Not for the sake of winning heaven,
Or of escaping hell;

Verse 5
Not with the hope of gaining aught;
Not seeking a reward;
But as Thyself hast loved me,
O ever-loving Lord.

Verse 6
E'en so I love Thee, and will love,
And in Thy praise will sing;
Because Thou art my loving God
And my eternal King.
