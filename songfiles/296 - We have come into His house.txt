Song 296 - We have come into His house

We have come into His house,
And gathered in His name,
To worship Him (2)
We have come into His house
And gathered in
His name to worship Christ the Lord,
Worship Him, Jesus Christ the Lord.

So forget about yourself
And concentrate on Him
And worship Him. (2)
So forget about yourself
And concentrate on Him
To worship Christ the Lord
Worship Him, Jesus Christ the Lord

He is all my righteousness,
I stand complete in Him
And worship Him (2)
He is all my righteousness,
I stand complete in Him,
And worship Christ the Lord
Worship Him, Jesus Christ the Lord

So let's lift up holy hands
And magnify His name
And worship Him (2)
So let's lift up holy hands
And magnify His name
And worship Christ the Lord
Worship Him, Jesus Christ the Lord.
