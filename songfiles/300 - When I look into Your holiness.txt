Song 300 - When I look into Your holiness

When I look into Your holiness
When I gaze upon Your loveliness
When all things that surround me
Become shadows in the light of You
When I found the joy of reaching your heart
When my will becomes enthralled in your love
When all things that surround me
become shadows, In the light of You

I worship You (x2)
The reason I live, is to worship You
I worship You (x2)
The reason I live, is to worship You
