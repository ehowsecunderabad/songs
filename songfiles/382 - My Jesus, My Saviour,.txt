Song 382 - My Jesus, My Saviour,

My Jesus, My Saviour,
Lord there is none like You,
All of my days, I wan to praise,
The wonders of Your mighty love;
My Comfort, my Shelter,
Tower of refuge and Strength,
Let every breath, all that I am,
Never cease to worship You.
Shout to the Lord,
All the earth let us sing,
Power and Majesty Praise to the King,
Mountain bow down,
And the seas will roar,
At the sound of Your Name;
I'll sing for Joy at the works of Your
hand
Forever I'll love you, forever, I'll
stand
Nothing compares to the promise
I have in You.
