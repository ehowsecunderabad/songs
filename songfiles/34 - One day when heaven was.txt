Song 34 - One day when heaven was

Verse 1
One day when heaven was
filled with His praises,
One day when sin was
as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be
born of a virgin '
Dwelt amongst men,
my example is He!

Chorus 1
Living, He loved me;
Dying, He saved me;
Buried, He carried
my sins far away;
Rising, He justified
freely forever:
One day He's coming '
O, glorious day!

Verse 2
One day they led Him
up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him
to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish,
despised, and rejected;
Bearing my sins,
my Redeemer is He!

Verse 3
One day they left Him
alone in the garden,
One day He rested,
from suffering free;
Angels came down o'er
His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless,
my Saviour is He!

Verse 4
One day the grave could
conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled
away from the door;
Then He arose, over death
He had conquered;
Now is ascended,
my Lord ever more!

Verse 5
One day the trumpet
will sound for His coming,
One day the skies
with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day,
my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Saviour,
this Jesus is mine!
